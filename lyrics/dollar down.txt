Friend of mine bought an automobile,
At a dollar down and a dollar a week.
Every time he turned the wheel,
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week.

He went riding down the road,
And kissed this gal upon her cheek.
Speed cop took him to the judge,
He got a dollar down and a dollar a week.

Sixty days he laid in jail,
At a dollar down and a dollar a week.
Another man was a-lovin' his gal,
At a dollar down and a dollar a week.

When he got out he shot the man,
And he laid him in the graveyard six foot deep.
And when he bought the graveyard spot,
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week.
