Lots of folks say that healing comes
From things that you drink and eat;
Powders and pills and lotions to pour
In your mouth and stomach and feet.

Oils and salves and waxes and dyes,
In all of these gods they believe;
But the healing takes place by your faith and your work
And not in any of these.

Some would rather to trust in a weed
Or a mineral, root, or an herb.
Others put trust in a salt or a soap,
And not in the word of the Lord.

Some people go to the sugar sack,
And some to the kerosene can.
But healing ain't hiding in any of these;
It comes from the heart of man.

The rhubarb root and juniper juice,
Cornmeal ashes and liquor.
These things are but empty idle gods;
The fire of the spirit is quicker.

The soda and syrup and alkalines
Are as dead as an old doornail.
So put your faith in the work that you do,
And learn that faith will heal.

So put your faith in the work that you do,
And learn that faith will heal.

And not in any of these.
But the healing takes place by your faith and your work
And not in any of these.
