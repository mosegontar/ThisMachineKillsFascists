Come along boys and listen to my tale
Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Well, I started up the trail October twenty-third
Started up the trail with a 2-U herd
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Ten dollar horse and a forty dollar saddle
I'm going cut them Texas cattle
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Woke up one morning on the old Chisholm Trail
My rope in my hand and a cow by the tail
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Cloudy in the west, looking like rain
My danged old slicker's in the wagon again
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Jumped in the saddle and I grabbed that horn
The best blamed cowboy ever was born
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Don't give a damn if I never do stop
Ride just as long as an eight day flop
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Foot in the stirrup and a hand on the horn
The best danged cowboy ever was born
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Stray in the herd and the boss said, "Kill it,"
Hit him in the rump with the handle of a skillet
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Bacon and beans most every day
Soon to be eating that prairie hay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Best dang horse, going on a run
Quickest shooting cowboy ever pulled a gun
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Well, I went to the wagon to get my roll
Had had me figured nine dollars in the hole
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Well, sell my outfit quick as I can
And I won't punch cattle for no damn man
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Going to town to draw my money
Going to town to see my honey
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay

Knees in the saddle and a seat in the sky
Quit my boss and say goodbye
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yi yippee yay
Come a ki yi yippee yippee yay
