Well, the guns of war have roared
And the bombs and shells have fallen
The war clouds they rumbled as they rolled.
I was a soldier in the fight
And we fought till we won;
My uniform's my dirty overalls.

This piece of land that I stand on
Is my battlefield and home;
My plow and my hoe is my gun.
Clothes don't make no difference at all
We are workers and fighters all;
My uniform's my dirty overalls.

Well, I'll give you my sweat
I'll give you my blood
And I'll give you your bread and your wine.
Before I'd be any man's slave,
I would rot down in my grave.
And you can lay me down in my dirty overalls.

Well, we settled here to stay
and I'll stick here all my days;
I'll keep marchin' in my dirty overalls.
