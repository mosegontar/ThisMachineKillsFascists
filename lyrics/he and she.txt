He's like the wind from the mountain
She's like the high sky above
He's like an eagle there flying
She's like the sweet turtle dove.

He's like a storm o'er the oceans
She's like this springtime air
And he and she appear to be
Contented and a well married pair.

He's like the lions in the forest
She's like the deer in the shade
He's like a sun shining brightly
She's like a cool summer's glade.

He's like a wild tornado
She's like a day that's fair
And he and she are in love I can see
Contented and a well married pair.
