Wella, what got Joseph out o’ that hole?
God did, God did!
Who sent that rich man down that road?
God did, God did!
Who took Joseph by his hand
Who took him over to Egypt’s land
Who showed him the dreams of the Pharoah man?
God did, God did!

Who made Joseph high as the king?
God did, God did,
Who gave him power to read your dream?
God did, God did!
Who cause the hunger at Joseph’s home?
Who cause his brothers Three to come?
Who gave back all their money and gold?
God did, God did!

Who made his Father pack up and move?
God did, God did!
Who made him bring his flocks and wives?
God did, God did!
Who made old Pharoah speak to say:
You can dwell with me for all your days!
Who made come true young Joseph’s dream?
God did, God did!
