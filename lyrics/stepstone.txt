I stood on the stepstone when school days was over
And longed for the time to go by,
Now that it's gone I stand here tonight
To bid this old stepstone goodbye.

Goodbye to my stepstone, goodbye to my home,
God bless the ones that I leave with a sigh;
Fields will be whitening
And I will be gone to ramble this wide world alone.

I stand on my stepstone at eventide now,
The wind whistles by with a moan;
How did it start and I stand here tonight,
Good bye to my stepstone and home.

Goodbye to my stepstone, goodbye to my home,
God bless the ones that I leave with a sigh;
Fields will be whitening
And I will be gone to ramble this wide world alone.

It's hard to be parted from those that we love,
When reverses in fortune have come;
The world's strongest heart strings have broken in twain,
By the absence of loved ones and home.

Goodbye to my stepstone, goodbye to my home,
God bless the ones that I leave with a sigh;
Fields will be whitening
And I will be gone to ramble this wide world alone.
