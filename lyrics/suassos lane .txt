Suassos Lane is just an alley
Up here in old north Plymouth,
You saw my fish cart
Roll here is Suassos Lane.

CHORUS: Goodbye my comrades,
Goodbye my north Plymouth,
Goodbye to Boston harbor,
Goodbye to Suassos Lane.

They said I killed him,
Said I killed the payroll carrier,
Over in South Braintree,
Thirty-Five miles from Suassos Lane.

CHORUS

My name's Lefevre Brini.
On the same day, Bart Vanzetti
Brought fish to Cherry Court,
One block from Suassos Lane.

CHORUS

My name is Joseph Rosen.
I am a woolen peddler.
I sold Vanzetti a roll of cloth
This day in Suassos Lane.

CHORUS

I'm Mrs. Alphonsine Brini.
Mister Rosen and Cart Vanzetti
Showed me the cloth with the big holes in it
One block from Suassos Lane.

CHORUS

My name is Melvin Corl.
I was painting my fishing schooner.
Vanzetti talked to me an hour
A mile or so from Suassos Lane.

CHORUS

How could I be in South Braintree
Killing men in front of the factory,
When all these friends and others saw me
Cart my fish up Suassos Lane?

CHORUS

I tell you working people
Fight hard for higher wages,
Fight to kill black market prices;
This is why you take my life.

CHORUS

I tell you working people
Fight hard for cleaner houses,
Fight hard for wife and children;
That's why you took my life.
