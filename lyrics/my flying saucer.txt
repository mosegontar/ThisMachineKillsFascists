My flying saucer where can you be
Since that sad night that you sailed away from me?
My flying saucer I pray this night
You will sail back before the day gets bright

My flying saucer fly back for home!
You will get lost in the universe alone!
My flying saucer and all my fears
Sail back tonight, love and kiss away my tears
