I have loved her since I met her
She is all the world to me
She's my curly headed baby
Comes from sunny Tennessee.

I'm a-gonna tell you 'bout these women
I'm a-gonna tell you what they do
Hang their heads up on your shoulder
Flirt around with another too

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun refuses to shine
Than to see her with another
When you promised to be mine

I was happy when I kissed her
And she gave her love to me
She's the prettiest little baby
That ever fell in love with me

She's my curly headed baby
And I hope someday to be
Walking by her side forever
Down in sunny Tennessee.
