Went to kiss my sweetie, same as before;
In my face she slammed her door:
"Get out of my door, you got no peace pin on!
Get out of my door, you ain't got no peace pin on!"

CHORUS:
Peace, peace, peace, peace, boogie for peace,
Wanna kiss my sweet, I gotta boogie for peace.
Looks like I'm gona, ain't got no peace pin on;
Can't kiss my sweet peach when I've got no peace pin on!

I dropped in my tavern, same as before,
Barman booted my out of his door;
Says: "Got out of my bar, you ain't got no peace pin on:
Get out of my joint, you don't have no peace pin on!"

CHORUS

I went to visit heaven, same as before,
St. Peter slide me out of his back door;
Says: "Got out of my heaven, you don't have no peace pin on!
Got out of God's heaven, you don't have no peace pin on!"

CHORUS

I visited Hell's hole, same as before,
Old Devil he sent me right out of his fire;
Says: "Get out of my Hell, you don't have a peace pin showing!
Get out of my Hell, you haven't got your peace pin showing!"

CHORUS
