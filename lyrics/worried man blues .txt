It takes a worried man to sing a worried song,
It takes a worried man tossing a worried song,
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long!

Went across the river, I lay down to sleep;
Went across the river, I lay down to sleep,
When I woke up.had shackles on my feet!

Twenty one links of chain around my leg;
Twenty one links of chain around my leg;
And on each link.there's an initial of my name!

The train ride is twenty one coaches long;
Train I ride is twenty one coaches long;
And the gal I love . is on that train and gone!

Asked that judge what's gonna be fine;
Asked that judge what's gonna be fine;
Twenty one years on that rooky mountain line!

Twenty one years to pay my awful Crime!
Twenty one years to pay my awful crime!
Twenty one years! And I still got ninety Nine!
