I was born at Half Past 12, almost One in the morning;
I was born at Half Past One, almost Two in the morning.
Now my birthday comes again and I don't know how old I am;
Half past One or Two or Three, almost 4 in the morning.

I was born at Half Past Four, almost 5 in the morning;
I was born at Half Past Six, almost 7 in the morning;
How old am I, you ask of me? One year younger than I used to be;
Half Past 7, Half Past 8, Half Past Nine in the morning.

I was born at Half Past Nine, almost Ten in the morning;
I was born at 1/2 past Ten, almost 'Leven in the morning;
Today my age is Tweedle and 'twee I'm prettier than I used to be;
Half Past 'Leven, Half Past 'Leven, almost 12 in the morning.
