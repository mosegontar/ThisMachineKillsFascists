I like to swim in my water,
I like to swim in my water,
Water, water and water
Swim, swim, swimmy, I swim.

CHORUS
Swim, swim, swimmy, I swim, I swim.
Swim, swim, swimmy, I swim, oh swim.
Swim, swim, swimmy, I swim, I swim.
Swim, swim, swimmy, I swim, I swim.

I like to kick in my water,
Oh I like to kick in my water,
Water, water and water
And swim, swim, swimmy, I swim.

CHORUS

I like to splash in my water,
And I like to splash in my water,
Like to splash in my water,
And swim, swim, swimmy, I swim.

CHORUS

I like to float in my water,
And I like to float in my water,
Like to float in my water
And I swim, swim, swimmy, I swim.

CHORUS
