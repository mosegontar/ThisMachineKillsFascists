There's a little black train a-comin'
Comin' down the track;
You gotta ride that little black train,
But it ain't a gonna bring you back.

You may be a bar-room gambler
And cheat your way through life;
You can't cheat that little black train
Or beat this final ride.

You silken bar-room ladies,
Dressed in your worldly pride;
You've gotta ride that little black train
That's comin' in the night.

Your million dollar fortune,
Your mansion glittering white;
You can't take it with you
When the train moves in the night.

Get ready for your savior,
Anf fix your business right;
You've got to ride that little black train
That makes this final ride.

You silken bar-room ladies,
Dressed in your worldly pride;
You've gotta ride that little black train
That's comin' in the night.

You may be a bar-room gambler
And cheat your way through life;
You can't cheat that little black train
Or beat this final ride.

There's a little black train a-comin'
Comin' down the track;
You gotta ride that little black train,
But it ain't a gonna bring you back.
