I was good to you, and lovin’ all the time,
I was good to you, and lovin’ all the time,
I was good to you, and lovin’ all the time,
Still you never would be mine

You took away, my silver and gold,
You took away, my silver and gold,
You took away, my silver and gold,
But you sure can’t take away my soul

CHORUS:
It’s love, careless, reckless love
It’s love, careless, reckless love
It’s love, careless, reckless love
There’s nothing in this world that I won’t do.

My heart is sad and muddy all the time.
My heart is sad and muddy all the time.
My heart is muddy, got trouble rising high,
The one I love, just won’t be mine.

I stand here alone, in my back door,
I stand alone, in my back door,
I stand alone, in my back door,
And that’s something I never did before.

CHORUS
