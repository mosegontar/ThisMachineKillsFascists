Round and around my Hanukah tree
Round and around I go
Round and around my Hanukah tree
Because I love you so
Round and around my Hanukah tree
Round and around we go
Round and around Iâ€™ll hold your hand
Because you love me so
Round and around my Hanukah tree
Round and around we go
Round and round Iâ€™ll hold your hand
Because you love me so

Round and around our Hanukah tree
Round and around we go
Clap our hands as loud as we can
Because I love you so
Round and around our Hanukah tree
Round and around we go
Round and around our Hanukah tree
Because you love me so
Round and around our Hanukah tree
Round and around we go
Round and around our Hanukah tree
Because you love me so
