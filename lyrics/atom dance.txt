You go carry heavy water
I’ll get my solar bucket
Mix up with force and gravity
Dance around my atom fire.

Fill your sack of fiery forces
Trot down my neutron horses
Get down out of your atom wagon
Dance around my atom fire.

Write down your law of numbers
Marriage wings and relativity
I’ll bring my fourth dimension
We’ll sing by the atom fire.

Throw on some history pages
Words of your wits and sages
Throw on ten million ages
Warm by the atom fire.

Dance around my sweet titanium
Kiss my lips my pretty helium
We’ll look at the flames of nations
Sit here by my atom fire.
