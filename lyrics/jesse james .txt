Just about the worst gun battle ever out on the western plains
When me and a bunch of cowboys went running with Jesse James
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.

Run into Jesse James, boys, run into Jesse James
The guns went off like thunder and the bullets fell like rain
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.

The guns went off like lightning and the bullets fell like hail
Was on our way to Denver on the old Dodge City trail
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.

And in that bloody battle with Frank and Jesse James
My partners fell around me with bullets in their brains
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.

Frank and Jesse James, boys, they robbed that midnight mail
The bank and express station and broke the county jail
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.

If you're afraid to fight, boys, if you're afraid to die
You'd better stay out of the Badlands where the red hot bullets fly
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.

If you're afraid of dying, if you're afraid of death
You'd better stay at home, boys, stay out of Jesse's path
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.
Come a cow-cow yicky, come a cow-cow yicky, yicky yea.
