I signed aboard some sea ships
Just to see the ocean roll;
I flew the clouds in airplanes
Just to satisfy my soul.
Up in that big blue heaven
My hopes can freely roam
I will build my sundried brickwall
Where my soul can feel at home.

My angel, my darling,
When that atom bomb does come;
Let me by your pillow
While this world’s on fire.

Wildfire will run crawling
While the walls will come falling;
Lay your weary head down
While the world’s on fire.

When the flames go creeping;
When the smoke plume is leaping;
We’ll play like we’re sleeping
While the world’s on fire.

While the skies they’re clearing
We’ll rise up dreaming;
Build our city from the ashes
When the world was on fire.

My angel, my darling,
When that atom bomb does come;
Let me by your pillow
While this world’s on fire.
