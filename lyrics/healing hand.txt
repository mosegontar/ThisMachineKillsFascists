You, hand of life
From deaths own bed
How many times have you
Raised up my head?

Healing hand of life
To my lost soul
How many times did your faith
Make me whole?

Healing hand of life
Give me life’s power
To heal the brow I touch 
This very hour.

O’ healing hand of life
Give life to all
To stand this day and night
Our battle call.
