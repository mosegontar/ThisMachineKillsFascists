Oh captain tell me true,
does my sailor sail with you?
No, he does not sail with me,
He sleeps on the bottom of the sea.

CHORUS:
What did the deep sea say?
Tell me, what did the deep sea say?
It moaned and groaned
And it splashed and it foamed
And it rolled on its weary way.

Well, he promised he'd write to me,
but his promise he never kept true.
Never a word from my sailor have I heard
Since he sailed on that ocean blue.

CHORUS

A beautiful rose every day
I placed on the crest of the waves.
Said "Take it please,
And let the petals fall
Above his watery grave."

CHORUS
