Someday, some morning sometime, sometime
I'd like to hold your hand in mine,
Someday, some morning, sometime

I'd like to tell you you're pretty and fine,
Your face will smile and your eyes will shine
Someday, some morning, sometime

I'll build you a house all covered in vines,
I'll bring you a nickel, I'll bring you a dime,
Someday, some morning, sometime

Five six seven and eight oh nine
I'll take you down where the birds fly by
Someday, some morning, sometime
