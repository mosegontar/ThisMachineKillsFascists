Go on, friends, and meet at the family reunion
If one of us blows somewhere with the winds
Go on with your meeting, your drinking, and eating
If me or some other seem gone off away.

CHORUS
There never would be any family reunions
If some of you cry over one you see gone,
You've got to keep meeting with all of your family
If one or two pass and some others can't come.

Don't tell the others to stop all their weeping,
That's the best way to wash out your soul and your eyes
Just hug one another and sing with your drinking
And hold your reunion the same as you planned.

CHORUS
