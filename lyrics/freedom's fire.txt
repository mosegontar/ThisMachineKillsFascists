I’ll freeze here in my universe if I cant find  my fire to keep me
I dug through your highest mountain crawled in  your muddiest ditches
Hot jungle and windy desert looking for my  freedom’s fire.

Back past my revolutions, past my glacial ages I  sent spark of light
Every hand in every nation gave me my blood  donation
Every voice was yelling at me, go find our  freedom’s fire.

I got to be an atom buster, I was born in heavy  water,
My big experiment, my freedom’s eye.

Nursed by breast, a vacuum bottle,
Test tube the open sky, the clouds that fly,
Found it in all my people but scattered too far  apart
Run past my people, each one with a chunk of fire.

I walked on every planet, found it in ? moving
Found it in the middle of a heart
Swung on vine and cable, burned theories on your  table
Your systems out my windows looking for  freedom’s fire.

I got to be an atom buster, I was born in heavy  water,
My big experiment, my freedom’s eye.
