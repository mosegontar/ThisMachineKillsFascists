Tryin' to make a heaven my home, home!
Tryin' to make a heaven my home, sweet home!
This old world just ain't my home;
Tryin' to make a heaven my home!

Big wind blowed my crops all away!
This world ain't my home!
Looks like I just can't make the grade!
Gotta make heaven my home!

Tryin' to make a heaven my home, home
Tryin' to make a heaven my home, sweet home!
This old world just ain't my home;
Tryin' to make a heaven my home!

Cain't hold my dike 'gainst all this flood!
This world ain't my home!
I'll wash my soul in my Saviour's blood!
Gotta make heaven my home!

Tryin' to make a heaven my home, home
Tryin' to make a heaven my home, sweet home!
This old world just ain't my home;
Tryin' to make a heaven my home!

I lift and I bend, I sweat and I strain!
This world ain't my home!
Every job I touch is aches and pains!
Gotta make heaven my home!

Tryin' to make a heaven my home, home
Tryin' to make a heaven my home, sweet home!
This old world just ain't my home;
Tryin' to make a heaven my home!

What makes everybody run hide from me?
This world ain't my home!
I've gotta try to love everybody that I see!
Gotta make heaven my home!

Tryin' to make a heaven my home, home
Tryin' to make a heaven my home, sweet home!
This old world just ain't my home;
Tryin' to make a heaven my home!
