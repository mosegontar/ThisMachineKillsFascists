Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, pickle, pickle, pickle, pickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.

Hey, hey, hey, my little sack of sugar,
Ho, ho, ho, my little sack of sweet.
Hee, hee, hee, my pretty little angel,
Pretty, pretty, pretty, I could eat your feet.

Hey, hey, hey, my little honey bunny,
Ho, ho, ho, my little turtle dove,
Hee, hee, hee, my little sack of 'taters,
So pretty, pretty, pretty, I could eat your toes.

Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, pickle, pickle, pickle, pickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.

Hey, hey, hey, my tootsie wootsie,
Wrangle, tangle, dangle, and my honey in a tree.
Ho, ho, ho, my butterfly fritter,
So pretty, pretty, pretty I could eat your nose.

Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.

Google, google, google, a coo and a cuddle,
I kick your foot, like a bicycle pedal;
Pretty little hoot owl and a one-eyed frog,
So pretty, pretty, pretty I could gobble you whole.

Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle
Little sack of sugar I could eat you up.
