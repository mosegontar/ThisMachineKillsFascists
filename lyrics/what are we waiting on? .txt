There's a great and a bloody fight 'round this whole world tonight 
And the battle, the bombs and shrapnel reign 
Hitler told the world around he would tear our union down 
But our union's gonna break them slavery chains 
Our union's gonna break them slavery chains

I walked up on a mountain in the middle of the sky 
Could see every farm and every town 
I could see all the people in this whole wide world 
That's the union that'll tear old Hitler down
That's the union that'll tear the fascists down

When I think of the men and the ships going down 
While the Russians fight on across the dawn 
There's London in ruins and Paris in chains 
Good people, what are we waiting on? 
Good people, what are we waiting on?

Yes, I thank the Soviets and the mighty Chinese vets 
Allies the whole wide world around 
To the battling British, thanks, you can have ten million Yanks 
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down, down, down 
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down

But when I think of the ships and the men going down 
While the Russians fight on across the dawn 
There's London in ruins and Paris in chains 
Good people, what are we waiting on? 
Good people, what are we waiting on?

So I thank the Soviets and the mighty Chinese vets 
Allies the whole wide world around 
To the battling British, thanks, you can have ten million Yanks 
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down, down, down 
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down
