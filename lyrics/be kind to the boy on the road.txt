Who is that boy  on the white winding highway?
Why does he roam  alone?
Is he looking  for life on that white winding highway?
For his parents dealt  him trouble at home.

And I think he’s  wrong standing there on that highway
Oh what a  foolish young lad
But you yourself  might be standing on that highway
If you had his  trouble on your hands.

Don’t point your  finger at that boy on the highway
As you travel  down this road
Either give him  your help or pass him with kindness
Cause he’s got  all the trouble that he wants
