If I get up and  let you in,
I lose my house  and my home again;
If I get up and  try to come,
I get sent back  to the land I’m from.

The cloud came  low and the rain did pour;
I hear your hand  touch on my door;
The rain has  quit and the light of the moon
Shows you  standing in my room.

CHORUS:
Bugeye Jim, I  can’t come;
I can twist and  turn, but I can’t come,
I can ache and I  can burn, but I can’t come.
I work up this  morning with an aching brain;
Hear you tap on  my window pane.

I look at your  with a heavy head;
I hear you sit  down on my bed;
The storm gets  worse and my heart feels bare;
I feel your  fingers comb my hair.

The mud it runs  and the waters rise;
I feel your  hotkiss on my eyes;
The rain it rained  and the world did stir;
I sing to you my  lovesick word.

CHORUS
