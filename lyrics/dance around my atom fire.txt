Bring all my history pages
Bring all my wits and sages
Back down from the glacial ages
Dance around my atom fire

Bring all my blood relations
Bring all my worried nations
Back down through my civilizations
Dance around my atom fire

CHORUS:
Dance around my atom fire
Dance around my atom fire
Dance around my atom fire
Dance around my atom fire

I'll bring my sons and daughters
I'll bring my heavy waters
Titanium Uranium
Dance around my atom fire

Bring all my lads and lasses
Nitro and blister gasses
Brotherhood or a world of ashes
Dance around my atom fire

CHORUS

The brightest of eyes and faces
Down out of my history places
All of my humnaly races
Dance around my atom fire

Warfare is not the settlement
Bloodshed is not the element
Shake hands and work together
Dance around my atom fire

CHORUS
