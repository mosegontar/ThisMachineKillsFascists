All alone! All alone!
In this world all alone
I have no parents of my own
It seems such a pity
As I roam thru the city
I am left in this world all alone.

I have wept I have cried
I walk from side to side
I see not a soul that I know
I walk from end to end
I see not a friend
I am left in this world all alone.

As I walk down the street
No familiar face I meet
And I roam thru the rain and the cold
I have walked thru the town
Not a friend have I found
I am left in this world all alone.
