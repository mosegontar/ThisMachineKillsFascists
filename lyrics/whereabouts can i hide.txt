Justice,  oh, justice,
Whereabouts  can I hide?
Libertyâ€™s locked up by the  fascists tonight!
Freedom  got sold
For  her carcass and bones!
Justice,  oh, justice,
Whereabouts  can I hide?

Freedom, oh, freedom,
Whereabouts do you hide?
I looked through my wrecked street, but you I  cannot find
Peace got beat up, by the Stormtroops last  night.
Freedom, oh, freedom,
Whereabouts do you hide?

Democracy, democracy,
Hey, lift up your head!
This is the same curbstone where my family bled.
The voters are voting
Whilst the blood soaks it red.
Democracy, democracy,
Hey, lift up your head!
