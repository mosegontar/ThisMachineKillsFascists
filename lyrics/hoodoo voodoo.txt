Hoodoo voodoo,
Seven twenty, one two;
Haystacks, hostacks,
A B C.
High poker, low joker,
Ninety nine a Zero;
Sidewalk, streetcar,
Dance a goofy dance.

Blackbirdy, bluejay;
One two three four;
Trash back, jump back,
E F G.
Biggy hat, little hat,
Fattyman, skinnyman;
Grasshopper, greensnake,
Hold my hand.

Hoodoo voodoo
Chooka chooky choochoo;
True blue, how true;
Kissle me now.

Momma cat, Tommy Kat,
Diapers on my clothes line;
Two four six eight;
I run hide.
Pretty girl, pretty boy,
Pony on a tincan.
I’ll be yours and you’ll be mine.

Jinga jangler, tingalingle;
Picture on a bricky wall;
Hot and scamper, foamy lather;
Huggle me close.
Hot breeze, old cheese,
Slicky slacky fish tail;
Brush my hair and kissle me some more.
