You oil field workers, come and listen to me
I'm goin' to tell you a story about old John D.
That company union made a fool out of me.
That company union don't charge no dues
It leaves you a-singing them Rockefeller blues.
That company union made a fool out of me.

Takes that good ole C.I.O., boys
To keep that oil a-rollin', rollin' over the sea.
Takes that good ole C.I.O., boys
To keep that oil a-rollin' over the sea.

Drilling oil to beat Japan
But the company union don't give a damn.
That company union made a fool out of me.
The oil field workers and the NMU
Going to beat Hitler, and damn quick, too.
That company union made a fool out of me.

Old Berlin to Tokyo
Tanks can't roll if the oil don't flow.
That company union made a fool out of me.
Canada to Mexico
They're joining up with the C.I.O.
That company union made a fool out of me.

C.I.O. is the place for me
When this war is over, I want to be free
That company union made a fool out of me.
I'm a union man in a union war
It's a union land I'm a-fightin' for.
That company union made a fool out of me.
