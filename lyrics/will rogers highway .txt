This big highway goes from coast to coast,
From New Yorker town down to Los Angeles;
It's named for Willy Rogers that went on this road
From New Yorker town down to Los Angeles .

My Sixty-Six highway, this Will Rogers road,
It's lined with jalopies just as far as I can see;
Can you think up a joke, Will, for all o'these folks
From New Yorker town down to Lost Angeles?

Ten thousand lost families I count every day
Caught under my bridges and under my trees;
Can you make up a joke that'll win them a job
From New Yorker town down to Lost Angeles?

I love Willy Rogers, I love your big smile,
I go to my showhouse, Will Rogers to see;
Can you grin up a tale that'll feed my folks stranded
'Twist New Yorker town and Lost Angeles?

This Will Rogers highroad I hitched lots o'times;
All day long you sizzle; all night long I freeze;
Did ye tickle Hoover enuf ta build us all houses
From New Yorker town down to Lost Angeles?

Willy Rogers got born down around Oolagah,
In my great Indian nation of the Cherokee;
My Indians all call this the Hungry Gut Highway
From New Yorker town down to Lost Angeles.

I bummed this good road with folks you call Goons,
And your high families called us the lost refugees;
You hafta go back, Will, and tickle 'em again
From New Yorker town down to Lost Angeles.
