Eisler on the go,
Eisler on the move
Brother is on the Vinegar truck and
I don't know what I'll do

I don't know what I'll do,
I don't know what I'll do
Eisler's on the come and go and
I don't know what I'll do

Eisler on the farm,
Eisler on the town
Sister in the tickly bush and
I don't know what I'll do

Eisler on the boat,
Eisler on the ship
Daddy on the henhouse roof and
I don't know what I'll do

Eisler in the jailoe,
Eisler back at home,
Ranking scratch his head and cry and
I don't know what I'll do

Eisler him write music,
Eisler him teach school,
Truman him don't play so good and
I don't know what I'll do
