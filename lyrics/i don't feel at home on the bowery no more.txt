I’ll sing you a song of the place that I stay
Once on this Bowery I use to be gay
Carefree and rambling in days of yore
But I don’t feel at home on the Bowery no more.

The flops they are lousy, the men are so thick,
You can’t go to sleep and you can’t sleep a wink
They mumble and grumble, they snarl and they snore
I don’t feel at home on the Bowery no more.

The beds are so small that your feet touch the wall
The bedbugs so big that they swallow you whole
The lice are so thick that they cover the floor
I don’t feel at home on the Bowery no more.

I seen an apartment on Fifth Avenue
A penthouse and garden with a skyscraper view
The carpets so soft with a hardwood floor
I don’t feel at home on the Bowery no more.

I like my good whiskey,  I like my good wine,
And good looking women to have a good time
Cocktail parties and the big built in bar
So I don’t feel at home on the Bowery no more.

I got disgusted and I wrote this song
I may be right and I may be wrong
But since I seen the difference ‘tween rich and the poor
I don’t feel at home on the Bowery no more.
