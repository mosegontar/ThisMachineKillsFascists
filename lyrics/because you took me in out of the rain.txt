My life it was weary till you came along,
So empty, so lonesome, and gray.
I'll always be thankful to you because -
You took me in out of the rain.

You took me in out of the rain, sweetheart,
You took me in out of the rain.
My heart was so gray, but today it is gay;
You took me in out of the rain.

The clouds in the sky turned lonesome and dark;
The world was against me, it seemed.
To-day, I am singing as gay as a lark,
You took me in out of the rain.

The wind whistled â€˜round me, dreary and cold;
My poor heart knew nothing but pain.
To God in His Heaven, I'm thankful, because -
You took me in out of the rain.

Chorus:
My friends and my fortune and money had gone,
I thought I was going insane,
To-day I'm as fit as a fiddle, because -
You took me in out of the rain.

There's somebody waiting for every one,
Your prayers are not spoken in vain.
When two lonely hearts get together, it takes
Them both in out of the rain.
