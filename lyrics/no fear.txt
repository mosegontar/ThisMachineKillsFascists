I got no fear of life
I got no fear of death
I got no fear of life
I got no fear of death
I got no fears of life
I got no fears of death
I got no fears of life
I got no fears of death

I’m here on my deathbed
Breathin’ my last breath
I’m here on my deathbed
Takin’ my last breath
‘Cause I got no fears in life
I got no fears of death
I got no fears in life
I got no fears of death

Death oh death you’re my best friend
Death oh death you’re my best friend
I got no fears in life
I got no fears in death

Such a pretty, pretty place, I seen past my  grave
Such a pretty, pretty place, I seen past my  grave
I got no fears in life
I got no fears in death
I got no fears in life
I got no fears in death
I got no fears in life
I got no fears in death
