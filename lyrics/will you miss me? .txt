When death'll close my eyelids
And my race on earth is run,
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Will you miss me (miss me miss me miss me)
Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Come and set yourself beside me
Come and set beside my bed.
Lay your hand upon my brow
While my achin' heart grows dead.

Will you miss me (miss me miss me miss me)
Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Will you miss me (miss me miss me miss me)
Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
