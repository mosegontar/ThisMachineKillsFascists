You're a cute little fellow, I see
And they say that you look like me
And they say that you look like mother too
Little fellow, you've come to stay.

How far have you come, little fellow?
Has your trip been long on the way?
For I see that you sleep all snuggled n warm
By your mother, your mother, little fellow.

You're a regular fellow, I see,
And you smile in your sleep as you dream
This life is a laff! And you've started out right,
With a smile, little fellow, for me

If again I could be, little fellow,
As young and as handsome as you
I would live life all over exactly the same
So I'd meet, little fellow, with you.
