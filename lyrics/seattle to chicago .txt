Now we're gonna catch an old freight train out of Seattle, Washington and we're gonna ride her all the way to New York City.

First you go down to Seattle there and you catch this old train out of the shed. She goes something like this.

Then when you get over there to the other side of the Rocky Mountains where she's coming downhill, she runs something like this.

Then when you get up about St. Paul, Minnesota or you're heading down toward Chicago, you catch the Baltimore. Here's the way the Baltimore sounds.

Then when you get down there to Chicago, you've got to change over from the Baltimore to the Nickel Plate. So you go down to the freight yards and you ask the night watchman, you say, "Hey mister."
