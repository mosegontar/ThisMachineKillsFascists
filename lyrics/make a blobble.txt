Oh my little baby,
If you don't make a blubble,
You'll swell up your tummy like a big balloon.

You'll fly up so high
In the clouds and skies
If you don't make a blubble
Make a blubber, pretty soon.

Patty patty back back,
Patty patty back back,
Peter patter snicker snacker,
Blow a bubble soon.

Patty patty back back,
Patty patty back back,
Peter patter snicker snacker,
Blow a bubble soon.

Oh you'll fly 'cross the ocean,
And you'll fly 'cross the sea.
If you don't make a blubble,
Just wait and see.

All the people, they'll see you
Flying up to the moon
Like a big balloon-er
Make a bleeble pretty soon.

Patty patty back back,
Patty patty back back,
Peter patter snicker snacker,
Blow a bubble soon.

Patty patty back back,
Patty patty back back,
Peter patter snicker snacker,
Blow a bubble soon.
