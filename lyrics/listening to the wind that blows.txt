There’s a girl  as she sleeping
Sleeping in her  sweet repose
I’m her broken  hearted sweetheart
Listening to  that wind that blows.

When my good  friends gather around me
Where my graveyard  flowers grow
In my grave I be  there sleeping
Listening to  that wind that blows.

CHORUS:
Blow, wind, blow, long low and lonesome
Blow, wind, blow, where no heart knows,
I’m your lonesome hearted listener
Listening to that lonesome wind that blows.

On those ocean  sands I wandered
Where those  whitecap breakers roll
I walked along  the beach at midnight
Listening to  that wind that blows.

In this great  and crowded city
Where the silver dollar flows
Many’s the broken hearted sweetheart
Listening to that  wind that blows.

CHORUS

I dreampt last  night we lay together
Arm in arm we  took a stroll
I woke up and  the sky was cloudy
Listening to  that wind that blows.

Has it come your  time to leave me?
Has it come your  time to go?
Always, dear,  I’ll be here waiting,
Listening to that wind that blows.
