I just got my army call
And I run down to the army hall.
Sally come a-runnin' like a cannonball
And I told her not to grieve after me.

It's-a when I'm gone, Sally, don't you grieve
It's-a when I'm gone, Sally, don't you grieve
It's-a when I'm gone, Sally, don't you grieve
And I told her not to grieve after me.

I'm a-gonna cross that ocean wide
Army rifle by my side
When Hitler's beat you can be my bride
But I told her not to grieve after me.

I'm a-gonna jump in a flyin' machine
A-loaded full of this-a TNT
Stop old Hitler what I mean
And I told her not to grieve after me.

A souvenir I'll send to you
Send Hirohito and Hitler, too
That's about all one feller can do
But I told her not to grieve after me.

Sally, get a job and save your pay
Work your best for the U.S.A.
Write me a letter 'bout ever' day
And I told her not to grieve after me.

If a blackout comes to the old home town
Sally, won't you pull your curtains down
If a shade goes up and a ship goes down
I told her not to grieve after me.
