This world looks like a chain
Of heavy broken hearts . . .
It chains my brothers and  sisters all apart
Link after link
It clatters thru my land
This long heavy chain of broken  hearts.

Selfish pride is one link in  this chain
And you better drive it out of  your heart –
Brother – sister when you do it’s  then that you’ll get loose
From this long heavy chain of  broken hearts.

CHORUS
It’s this long heavy chain of broken hearts
It’s this long heavy chain of  broken hearts
You gotta find your union before  you can get free
From this long heavy chain of  broken hearts.

Fear is a link in this chain
Of sorrow and trouble and pain .  . .
Drive out your fear and you will  break apart
This long heavy chain of broken  hearts.

Jealousy in a link of the worst
A worry, a blister and a curse .  . .
Join our union band and bring  with your hands
This long heavy chain of broken  hearts.

CHORUS

It’s when you are free from this  chain
Love will come and filled you up  again
Show your friends and neighbors how  to break away
From this long heavy chain of  broken hearts.

CHORUS
