CHORUS:

I'm gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger!
I'm gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger!
I'm gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger!
I'm gonna get bigger I'm gonna get bigger
I'll be just as big as you or biggerI'm growing higher and higher and lots higher
I'm growing higher and higher and lots higher
My feet and my head, my hands and my face
I'm gonna drink my orange juice, babe
I'll be just as high as you or higher
