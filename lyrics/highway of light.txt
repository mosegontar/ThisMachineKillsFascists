All thru this night dear
my highway of light dear
Lights up the night dear
My highway of light.

All along my big roadside
I'll raise you a house, dear
our house will shine bright here
By my highway of light.

The night it looks dark, dear
But you mustn't fear, dear,
Our cities they'll shine here
By my highway of light.

The sun & the stars dear
They'll shine on our highway
They'll shine on our home here
By my highway of light.

The lights will shine down dear
On all of our blossoms
our seeds and our harvests
By my highway of light.

By the starlight above you
I'll tell you I love you
and you'll shine for me by
my Highway of Light.
