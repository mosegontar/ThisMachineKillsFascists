They were  strolling in the gloaming
Through the  roses were in bloom,
A soldier and  his sweetheart brave and true;
And their hearts  were filled with sorrow
As their  thoughts were of tomorrow,
As she pinned a  rose upon his coat of blue.

Do  not ask me, Love, to linger
For  you know not what to say,
For  Duty calls your Sweetheart’s name again;
And  your heart need not be sighing
If  I be among the dying;
I’ll  be with you when the Roses bloom again.

When the Roses  Bloom again beside the River,
And the mockingbird  has sung his sweet refrain;
In the Days of  Auld Lang Syne,
I’ll be with you  Sweetheart mine,
I’ll be with you  when the Roses bloom again.

With the rattle  of the battle
Came a whisper  soft and low,
A soldier who  had fallen in the fray;
I am dying, I am  dying, and I know I have to go,
But I want to  tell you before I pass away:

There’s  a far and distant river
When  the Roses are in bloom
A  sweetheart who is waiting there for me.
And  its there I pray you take me
I’ve  been faithful, don’t forsake me,
I’ll  be with her when the roses bloom again!
