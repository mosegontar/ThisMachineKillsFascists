CHORUS
Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, my yellow crayon.
Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, my yellow crayon.
Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, my yellow crayon.
Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, my yellow crayon.

Well if you want to use my yellow crayon,
Go ahead and use my yellow crayon.
If you want to write, if you want to draw,
Go ahead and use my yellow crayon.

I put on my table my yellow crayon
So sister and brother and daddy and mom
Can see on my table my yellow crayon
And you can all use my yellow crayon.

I skipped home from school, from school today,
And I went to find my yellow crayon.
Mommy and daddy had broke it in two
And both was using my yellow crayon.

Well if you'd like to use my yellow crayon
Just ask for me and my yellow crayon.
I'll let you use my yellow crayon,
And I'll go and get you my yellow crayon.

Now when you buy me some more crayons
Get me a whole lot of yellow crayons.
Everybody uses my yellow crayons
And I'll need plenty of yellow crayons.

CHORUS

My yellow crayon, my yellow crayon,
And if you lose my yellow crayon,
Then I'll cry for my yellow crayon,
'Cause I wouldn't have me no yellow crayon.

Just ask me to bring you my yellow crayon,
And I'll ask you, "My yellow crayon?"
You say to me, "Your yellow crayon"
And I'll tell you, "Here's my yellow crayon."

You can write letters with my yellow crayon,
Pictures and numbers in yellow crayon.
It's my yellow, my yellow crayon,
And I want you to use my yellow crayon.

Now when I'm at home, my yellow crayon,
Playin' with the kids, my yellow crayon,
Swimmin' in the water, my yellow crayon,
I'll be glad to bring you my yellow crayon.

You have used my yellow crayon,
You wore it down little, my yellow crayon.
You wore it so small, my yellow crayon,
I can't even hold it, my yellow crayon.

CHORUS
