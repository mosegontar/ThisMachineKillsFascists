The lonesomest sound, boys,
I ever heard sound, boys,
On the stroke of midnight,
Hear the curfew blow.

My buddy will hang, boys,
On the hangman's rope, boys,
On the Gallus Pole, boys,
When the curfew blows.

Hear the curfew blowing,
Hear the curfew blowing,
In the coal black midnight,
Hear the curfew blow.

The sheriff's men, boys,
Are on my trail, boys,
In the midnight wind, boys,
Hear the curfew blow.

And when they catch me,
My body will hang, boys,
On the Gallus Pole, boys,
When the curfew blows.

Hear the curfew blowing,
Hear the curfew blowing,
In the coal black midnight,
Hear the curfew blow.
