CHORUS:
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight, goodnight,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight, goodnight,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight.

You've played, little darlin', all day
Your eyes are sleepy, I see,
Boys and girls are all sleepin' tight,
Goodnight little darlin', good night.

CHORUS

You've played, little darlin' all day,
With dolls and wagons and clay,
Your bath was warm and your jammers are nice,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight.

CHORUS

You hurt your finger, I see,
Come here and bring him to me.
Wrap little finger up nice and tight,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight.

CHORUS

You danced and sung with the kids,
Told me all that you did,
Told me your games and told me your fights,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight.

CHORUS

Tippy tip toe now to bed,
Snug and snug down your head,
Cover you over so nice and tight,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight.

CHORUS

I'll see you when the morning gets bright,
Don't let the beddybugs bite,
We'll both jump up when the sun gets light,
Goodnight, little darlin', goodnight.

CHORUS
