Don’t  let anything knock your props out from under you
Always  keep your mind clear, let your plans come out of mistakes
These  are the plans and nothing can tear down
Made  out of things that have already been torn down

Whatever  you do, wherever you go
Don’t  lose your grip on life and that means
Don’t  let any earthy calamity knock your dreamer and your hoping machine

Music  is the language of the mind that travels
Carries  the key to the laws of time and space
Lonesome  train whistling down the silent wail of wind
Life  is the sound, creation has been a song

Whatever  you do, wherever you go
Don’t  lose your grip on life and that means
Don’t  let any earthy calamity knock your dreamer and your hoping machine

Out  of order

Quick  to manufacture their schemes and ideas
Faster  than any turn a tide can wash you out
Word  is the music and the people are the song
Tomorrows  chances feel like a singing god

Whatever  you do, wherever you go
Don’t  lose your grip on life and that means
Don’t  let any earthy calamity knock your dreamer and your hoping machine

Out  of order
