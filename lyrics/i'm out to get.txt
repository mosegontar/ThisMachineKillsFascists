I’m out to get  your greenback dollar
I’m out to get  your silver change
I’m out to get  your long black limo
You kept me down  on my knees too long.

Now my daddy  before me worked like I work
He was worked to  death forty years or so
My mammy she  died from grieving over him
How old she was  I never did know.

I’m out to get  your greenback dollar
I’m out to get  your silver change
I’m out to get  your long black limo
You kept me down  on my knees too long.

Now the building  you own you won at gambling
On dice and  horses and ticker-tape machines
But that’s no  sign that you are smarter that I am
I’m going to  show you just what I mean.

I’m out to get  your easy money
I’m out to get  my share of your gold
I’m out to get  my whiskey and women
I’m going to get  back my life you stole.

We went to the  judge and I talked with the tenants
We told him we  had no hot water in the sink
He spent a half  and hour upon his bench there
To tell us what  a fine reputation our landlord’s got.

But I’m out to  get your long green tender
I’m out to get  your round town car
I’m out to fight  and win a good job and wages
And a six room  twin bed flat with a built in bar.

We told that  judge how you played the horses
How you won this  apartment building here
How you took our  money and headed to Florida
To lay in the  sun with women while we freeze here.

So, I’m out to  get your excess bacon
I’m out to get  my cut from you
I’m going to  walk and talk and tell all my neighbors
How they ought  to talk right up for their cut too.

It won’t be with  no gun nor gambling wheel sir
That I will use  to relieve you of your till
It will be in a  nice friendly way with all my neighbors
Smelling and  barking brother up and down your hill.

And you can’t  hide along no oceans
And you can’t  hide in no desert for long
We’re out to get  back every penny that you won gambling
Because we can’t  live, landlord, on a race horse song.
