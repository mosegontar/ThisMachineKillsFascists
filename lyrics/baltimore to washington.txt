I've gambled down in the town of Newport News
The more I gamble, boys, the more I lose
Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington

Oh Baltimore to Washington
I guess they got troubles, too

Well, the hobos know me up and down the line
They don't know the trouble on my mind
I guess they got troubles, too
I guess they got troubles too, boys
I guess they got troubles, too
I guess they got troubles too, boys
From Baltimore to Washington

And the police know me up and down the line
They don't know the trouble on my hands
I guess they got troubles, too
I guess they got trouble too, boy
I guess they got troubles, too
I guess the police they've got their troubles, too
From Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington
I guess they've got troubles, too

Going up north, I'm a-going north this fall
If my luck don't change I won't be back at all
From Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington, boys
Oh Baltimore to Washington
Oh Baltimore to Washington
Well, I guess they got troubles, too
