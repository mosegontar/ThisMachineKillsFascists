My flowers grow green
So pretty to see;
My true love has promised to come back to me;
He promised to stay
For a lifetime through
And change my sad flowers to the red white and blue.

He held me and kist me
And swore he'd be mine
When he came back last trip from the deep salty brine
It was on that sweet morning
That I told him I cared;
And a bouquet of new hope he tied in my hair.

My roses of summer,
My violets for spring;
Forgetmenots bloomed round my cheeks like a ring;
Buttercups and daisies
Peeping so shy;
Nobody can love you as dearly as I.

My pinks and my phlox,
And my four o'clocks all;
Love vines are climbing my high garden wall;
My flowers brought you
From across that sad sea;
You'll never kiss another one pretty as me.

My flowers brought you
From across that sad sea
You'll never kiss another, prettier than me
