I  am flying on this plane
Back  into your arms again
And  my eyes are sad and cloudy
And  my teardrops fall like rain.

As  I look down past my wind
Flying  home to you again
On  the clouds I see your picture
While  the engine sings your name.

CHORUS:
I’m  flying high, up in the sky
But  my heart keeps looking for you
All  around, down on the ground.
On  every hill, in every house
I  see your face in every window, down below.

I  am thinking, flying here
Of  those arguments we had
Of  the times we slammed our door
And  said, goodbye, goodbye

I  walked away a dozen times,
I  drove away a hundred more,
But  all the trains and all the buses
Brought  me back here to our door.

I’m  flying high, up in the sky
But  my heart keeps looking for you
All  around, down on the ground.
On  every hill, in every house
I  see your face in every window, down below.

I’m  flying high, up in the sky
But  my heart keeps looking for you
All  around, down on the ground.
On  every hill, in every house
I  see your face in every window, down below.
I  see your face in every window, down below.
