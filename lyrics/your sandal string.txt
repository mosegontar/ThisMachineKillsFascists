John the Baptist says of Jesus
The Son of God to you I bring
God he knows that I'm not worthy
To undo your sandal string

CHORUS:
To undo your sandal string
To undo your sandal string
Christ you know that I'm not worthy
To undo your sandal string
To undo your sandal string

I preach in jail I teach in prison
God's good song of love I sing
A son of God I shout before you
I couldn't undo your sandal string

CHORUS

My jailer cut off my head in prison
On your silvery platter to your queen
My head spoke that I'm not worthy
To undo your sandal string

CHORUS (2x)
