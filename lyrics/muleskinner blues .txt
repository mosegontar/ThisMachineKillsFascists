Good mornin', captain; Good mornin', son;
Good mornin', captain; Good morning' son;
Do you need another muleskinner out on your new road line?

Well, I like to work, I'm rollin' all the time;
I like to work, I'm rollin' all the time;
I can pop my initials on that mule's behind.

Well, it's hey, little water boy, bring your water 'round;
Hey, little water boy bring your water 'round;
If you don't like your job, let the water bucket down.

Well, I'm workin' on that new road at a dollar and a dime a day;
I'm workin' on that new road at a dollar and a dime a day;
I got three women watin' on a Saturday night just to blow my pay.
