When I die and I go to heaven
God will say you can’t stay here
I’ve soaked too much whiskey
Too many wines and beer
I’ve got too much goofball cocaine
On my brain
On my brain
I’ve got too much old kokaine
On my brain
On my brain

Ten million times I’ve been born and made
From the cradle to my grave
God sends me back to teach me
That liquors I should not crave
Nor to get too much old cocaine
On my brain
On my brain
Not to get too much kokaine
On my brain

When I die and I go to heaven
God will say you can’t stay here
I’ve soaked too much whiskey
Too many wines and beer
I’ve got too much goofball cocaine
On my brain
On my brain
I’ve got too much old kokaine
On my brain
On my brain
