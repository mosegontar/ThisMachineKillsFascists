Gonna nail me a black curtain
Up good an' tight
Do what my air raid man says is right
Gonna pull down my shade
An' turn out my light
Gonna be a Blackout
Blackout tonight

Gonna be a Blackout, Blackout tonight
Gonna be a Blackout tonight
Gonna do what my air raid man says is right
Gonna be a Blackout, Blackout tonight

My town is big
And my town is bright
My town can work and my town can fight
Gonna be a Blackout, Blackout tonight.

Gonna be a Blackout, Blackout tonight
Gonna be a Blackout tonight
Gonna do what my air raid man says is right
Gonna be a Blackout, Blackout tonight

Lights will go out
All over town
And the air raid warden will walk up and down
It's part of the war
I'm gonna do right
Gonna be a Blackout, Blackout tonight.
