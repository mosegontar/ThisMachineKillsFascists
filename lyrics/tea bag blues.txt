Well, it’s awful cold outside
And I’m cold at home tonight
Walkin up an’ down my my poor self
God you now this just ain’t right

Gonna boil myself a tea bag
Gonna boil myself a tea bag
And If you’ll moze above my way
I’ll boil you off a tea bag too

Well, I come from Oklahoma
Where that dust and gravel blow
I’ve got gals with boozeleg rotgut
But I never did learn to know

Just how to boil off a tea bag
How to simmer up a tea bag
And if you’ll ease over my way
I will boil you off a tea bag, too

I rode the trains and the busses
I rode the rods, I rode the blinds
Hit every kind of bag and satchel
I used every bait I could find

Never did think ‘bout no tea bag
Never did see no tea bag
But if you’ll ooze over closer
I will boil you off a tea bag, too
Yes, I will

I’ve used beer, and wine, and coffee
Buttermilk, soda and rum
And I rolled them every color
Seen them go before they come

Learnin’ how to use a tea bag
How to dip a tea bag
If you sneak over my way
I’m gonna strain your little tea bag too
Yeah, baby, that’s a promise

Learnin how to dip my tea bag
How to soak up my tea bag
And I’m up north in New York City
Singin’ my lonesome tea bag blues
