There once was a man in the holy land
Had nails in his feet.  Had nails in his hands.
Said mother and father I say unto thee
O’ suffer little children to come unto me.

You learn about hogs, you learn about sheep -
You learn about dogs, you learn how to eat -
You learn about cars, I say unto thee
O’ suffer little children to come unto me.

You learn to be doctors, you learn to read law
You learn how to ajudge and to pick every flaw
You go to your college and buy a degree
O ’suffer little children to come unto me.

You lean to opine and to philosophize
To argue and chatter and so criticize –
The sun and the moon and this astrology
O ’suffer little children to come unto me.

You learn about numbers and dollars and cents
The years of your life o’ so foolishly spent –
Bear this in mind as you lay doon to dee
O ’suffer little children to come unto me.
