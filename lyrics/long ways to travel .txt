Gonna leave the south
Going north for the fall
If my luck don't change, I won't be back at all

I've got a long ways to travel
I've got a long ways to travel
I've got a long ways to travel
Before I ever get home

Takes a rocking chair to rock
Rubber ball to roll
Black-haired woman to satisfy my soul

I've got a long ways to travel, I thought that you knowed
I've got a long ways to travel
I've got a long ways to travel
Before I ever get home
