My mama she leaves in the morning
Before the sky gets light
I never get to see her
When the sun is shining bright
She runs to catch the trolley
And she works in a factory place
But I like to stay home with daddy
'Cause he never does wash my face.

I eat any old thing I like to eat
At any old time I please
Bananas apples oranges and pork and beans
My daddy listens to the radio
And he hears the horses race
Yes, I like to stay home with daddy
'Cause he never does wash my face.

I bring in the kids from all around
And we fight with clay and mud
We roll and scream and rip and tear
Until we all get tired
Daddy is reading a magazine
He don't want to lose his place
So I like to stay home with daddy
'Cause he never does wash my face.

I like to stay home with you, daddy
'Cause you never do wash my face
You let me do whatever I please
And I snort and run and race
Mama will never know it
'Cause she never comes on the place
Oh I like to stay home with daddy
'Cause he never does wash my face.
