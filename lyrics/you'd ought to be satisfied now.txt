You jacked me up and you run me down
You nagged at me and you bawled me out
You made me leave town and I'm frisco bound
You'd ought to be satisfied now.

You took my silver, you took my gold,
You made me believe every lie that you told
You left me a standing out there in the cold
You'd ought to be satisfied now.

I'm down in this gutter I'm hungry, I'm cold,
You're drinking and gambling and wasting our dough
You'll never pay back that money you owe (yes, you owe)
You'd ought to be satisfied now.

You went around with whoever you pleased
I stood in the rain in my B. V. D.'s
There was times when I thought I would freeze
You'd ought to be satisfied now.

You got a new lover richer than me
You got a car and a boat on the sea
You spend all her money just to go on a spree
You'd ought to be satisfied now.

I'm down in this gutter I'm hungry, I'm cold,
You're drinking and gambling and wasting our dough
You'll never pay back that money you owe (yes, you owe)
You'd ought to be satisfied now.

I once had a fortune, you took that away,
A thousand cold dollars you spent every day
Tonight I'm a bum on a frisco bound train
You'd ought to be satisfied now.
