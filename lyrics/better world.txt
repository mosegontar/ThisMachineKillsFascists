CHORUS:

There's a better world that's a-coming
There's a better world that's a-coming
There's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why why why
And don't you see see see
And don't you know know know
Hey hey hey
There's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why why why
There's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why

There's a better world that's a-coming
Tell you why why why
Better world a-coming I'll tell you why
Out of marching out of battling
You can hear the chains a-rattling
There's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why

Now there's a better world that's a-coming
And there's a better world that's a-coming
And there's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why why why
Why why why
There's a better world that's a-coming
And don't you see see see
Better world that's a-coming
And don't you see see see
Better world that's a-coming
And don't you see

Well there's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why why why
better world that's a-coming I'll tell you why
We will beat'em on the land in the sea and in the sky
There's a better world that's a-coming
I'll tell you why

Well there's a better world that's a-coming
Don't you see see see
Better world that's a-coming don't you see
When we'll all be union and we'll all be free
There's a better world that's coming
don't you see

There's a better world a-coming
Don't you see see see
Better world that's coming don't you see
When we'll all be union and we'll all be free
There's a better world that's a-coming
Don't you see
