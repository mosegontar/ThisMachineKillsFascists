Howdy little newlycome
I'll sing to you my song
I'd like to tell you all about
The place you just come from
I'll hold you to my bosom
And I'll feel you nice and warm
I'll tell you how you found your way
To the world here where you were born
Di-di dee dee and da-dee, da-dee eye dum

Mommy and yer Poppy,
They eat some cake and bread
We drank a glass of brandy wine
Of white and yellow and red
We laughed and sang and hugged and kissed
And held each other's hands
And danced away together
To your newborn angel's land

We found honey sweet to make your feet
Good bread to make your head
And cheese to make your knees
Green vines to make your arms
With the wind that blows
We made your toes
And the rain that made your hands
This is how we found you
In your new born baby land

It was my door that you come through
To laugh and cry in this world
It's my same door I open up
For all my boys and girls
Your daddy and your mother
Did open their gates so wide
That you kicked your way without a scratch
From the new born baby's side

You come from me and I come from you
That's how we both did come
Milk and honey and bread and cheese
And berries and wine and rum
You feel so soft and tender and smooth
And warm here to my hand
I feel so glad that you can see me
From that new born baby's land

So it's howdy little newlycome
I'll sing to you my song
I'd like to tell you a little bit
About the place you just come from
I'll hold you to my bosom
You'll keep me nice and warm
And you'll tell me how you found your way
To the world here where you were born.
