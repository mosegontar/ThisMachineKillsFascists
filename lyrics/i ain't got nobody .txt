I ain't got nobody, ain't nobody got me,
I'm just like a little apple hangin' on a tree.
Don't nobody want me I can plainly see,
I ain't got nobody and ain't nobody got me.

I ain't got nobody, ain't nobody got me,
I'm just like a chunk of wood floatin' on the sea.
Don't nobody want me I can plainly see,
I ain't got nobody and ain't nobody got me.
