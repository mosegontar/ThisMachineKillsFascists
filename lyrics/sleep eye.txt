Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep-y little sleep eye.
Close the eye, close the eye, close-y eye my little sugar.
One eye closed, two eyes closed, go to sleep-y little sleep eye

Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep-y little sleep eye.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep-y little sleep eye. 
Eyes-y close, eyes-y close, eyes-y close my little sugar.

One hand asleep, two hands asleep, go to sleep-y little sleep eye. 
Dream a dream, dream a dream, dream a dream my little sweeter. 
Big dream, little dream, you got to go dream go to sleep-y little sleep eye.

Sleep-y sleep, sleep-y sleep, sleep-y sleep little sleep eye.
Sleep-y sleep, sleep-y sleep, sleep-y sleep little sleep eye.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, o to sleep-y little sleep eye.
