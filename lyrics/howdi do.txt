I stick out my little hand
To evâ€™ry woman, kid and man
And I shake it up and down, howjido, howjido
Yes, I shake it up and down, howjido

Howdy doozle doodle doozie
Howji hijie heejie hojie,
Howji hojie heejie hijie,
Howjido, howjido, howjido, sir,
Doodle doosie, howjido.

And when you walk in my door,
I will run across my floor,
And I'll shake you by the hand,
Howjido, howjido,
Yes, I'll shake it up and down, howjido

On my sidewalk, on my street,
Any place that we do meet,
Then I'll shake you by your hand,
Howjido, howjido,
Yes, I'll shake it up and down, howjido

When I first jump out of bed,
Out my window goes my head,
And I shake it up and down,
Howjido, howjido,
I shake at all my windows, howjido

I feel glad when you feel good,
You brighten up my neighborhood,
Shakin'hands with ev'rybody,
Howjido, howjido,
Shakin' hands with ev'rybody, howjido

When I meet a dog or cat,
I will rubby rub his back,
Shakey, shakey, shakey paw,
Howjido, howjido,
Shaking hands with everybody, howdy do.
