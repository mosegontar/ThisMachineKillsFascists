I'll write and I'll draw and I'll spell you a word,
Big "A" and a little "A" and a middle size "A"
I'll make you a number, two six and one:
And I'll scramble 'em around so you can see them run.

Take my pencil, crayon, and brush,
Big "B" and a little "B" and a new kind of "B";
I'll spell ten kitty-cats up in a tree,
And I'll squish 'em around so you can see.

Write, write, write, and scribble and scrap,
Big "C" and a little "C" and a middle size "C";
Write my mommy and write my dad
Prettiest letter I ever did read.

Splish splash, splish splash, chicky my chalk,
Mama "D", Papa "D" and a little baby "D";
Double one, double two, double "X", "Y", "Z",
Red, blue, and yellow, and a brown-eyed green.

I dibble, I dabble, I doodle, I write,
Grandma "E" and Grandpa "E" and a freckle-faced "D";
Everybody climbin' a green-leafed tree,
The funniest people I ever did see.

I'll write and I'll draw and I'll spell you a word
Big "A" and a little "A" and a middle size "A"
I'll make you a number, two six and one:
And I'll scramble 'em around and make 'em run.

Take my pencil, crayon, and brush,
Big "B" and a little "B" and a new kind of "B";
I'll spell ten kitty-cats up in a tree,
And squish 'em around so you can see.

Write, write, write, write, scribble and scrap,
Big "C" and a little "C" and a middle size "C";
Write my mommy and write my dad
The prettiest letter I ever did see.
