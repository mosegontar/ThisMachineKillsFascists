Howdy my friend, would you like to go riding
On the fastest of ponies that ever did run
Jump up in my saddle and hold the reins easy
We'll outride the wind and we'll outrun the sun.

Tee roodle, tee ridle, set high in my saddle
Tee roodle, tee ridle, you'll fly o'er the grass
Tee roodle, tee ridle, we'll jump this top fence rail
No rider can trail us, no rider can pass.

My hat and my scarf they blow back in the hard wind
His hooves pound the ground like a fast Indian drum
We jump the big ditch and he comes down so easy
He outruns the wild wind back home to his barn
He runs even faster back home to his barn.

Tee roodle, tee ridle, set tight in my saddle
Tee roodle, tee ridle, you'll fly o'er the grass
Tee roodle, tee ridle, we'll jump this top fence rail
No rider can trail us, no rider can pass.

Sit tight in my saddle, we'll pass this wild rabbit
We'll out fly that wild bird that rides on the wind
When he's back in his lot, you can comb him and rub him
The fastest of ponies that ever did run

Tee roodle, tee ridle, sit tight in my saddle
Tee roodle, tee ridle, you'll fly o'er the grass
Tee roodle, tee ridle, we'll jump this top fence rail
No rider can trail us, no rider can pass,
No rider can trail us, no rider can pass.
