Train whells can roll me, cushions can ride,
Ships on the ocean, planes in the skies,
Storms they can come and floodwaters, rise,
But I've got to get to Boston,
root hog and die

Nicola Sacco, a shoe-factory hand,
Bartolo Vanzetti, a trade union man,
Judge Webster Thayer swore they'll die,
But I've got to get to Boston 'fore sundown tonight.

I might walk around, and I might roll or fly,
Walking down this road shoulder, tears in my eyes,
They never done a wrong in their lives,
But Judge Webster Thayer says they must die.

Well, some come to Boston to see all the sights,
Some come to Boston to drink and to fight,
Sacco and Vanzetti told the workers, "Organize."
So Judge Webster Thayer says they must die.

Oh, Mr. Wagon Driver, please let me ride,
That's a nice pacing team that you've got here all right.
Did you ever hear such a thing in your life,
Judge Webster Thayer killing two men tonight.

Hey, Mr. Engineer, let me ride your train,
Throw in your coal and steam up your steam,
If I can't ride the shack, please let me ride the blind.
Go to get to Boston 'fore sundown tonight.
