I'ma drivin' down
Towards old Cheap Mike's
To see what I can do!
Gonna drive down
Towards old Cheap Mike's
Ta tell him a thing or two:
Sold me a forty eight motor
On a thirty two frame!
Think I'ma losin' my whole rear end!
I'ma drivin' down
To old Cheap Mike's
To see what I can do.

I'ma bouncin’ down
Towards old Cheap Mike's
To sing my used car blues;
I'ma foggin' on down
To old Cheap Mike's
Justa ask ‘im a thing ‘er two;
My radiator's bilin'!
My fender's gone!
Rods alla knockin'!
My wheels rollin' off!
I’ma whuppin’ ‘er down
Towerdz old Cheap Mike's
To see what I c’n do!

If’ ya gotta jalloppee
Or an old hotrod;
An' y' don't know what ta do;
Herd it on down towards
Old Cheap Mike's;
Ask him a thing or two;
If y’r valves are stickin';
If y’r crankshaft's flat;
If y’r losin' alla y’r bolts an’ taps;
Just guide ‘er and ride ‘er
Downta Cheap Mike's Lot;
‘Cause Mike knows what ta do!

I said guide it on down!
Whupp it on down!
Rattle it, straddle it,
Fight it on down!   
Any old way tag it it on down!
‘Cause Mike knows what ta do!

Hand Mike your money!

Mike knows what to do!
