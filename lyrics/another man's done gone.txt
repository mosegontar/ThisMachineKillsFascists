Sometimes I think I'm  gonna lose my mind
But it don't look like I ever do
I loved so many people everywhere I went
Some too much, others not enough

I don't know, I may go down or up or anywhere
But I feel like this scribbling might stay

Maybe if I hadn't of seen so much hard feelings
I might not could have felt other people's
So when you think of me, if and when you do,
Just say, well, another man's done gone
Well, another man's done gone
