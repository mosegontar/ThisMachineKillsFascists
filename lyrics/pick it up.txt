I drop my thumb, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my thumb, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my thumb, pick it up, pick it up
And put it back with my fingers.

I drop my candy, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my candy, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my candy, pick it up, pick it up
And throw it away in the garbage.

CHORUS:
Pick pick picka, pick it up, pick it up
Pick pick picka, pick it up, pick it up
Pick pick picka, pick it up, pick it up
Picka picka picka, pick it up, pick it up.

I drop my apple, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my apple, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my apple, pick it up, pick it up
And wash it clean in the water.

I drop my dolly, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my dolly, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my dolly, pick it up, pick it up
And lay her back in her cradle.

I drop my shoe, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my shoe, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my shoe, pick it up, pick it upAnd put it with my other shoe.

I drop my head, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my head, pick it up, pick it up
I drop my head, pick it up, pick it upAnd put it back on my shoulders.
