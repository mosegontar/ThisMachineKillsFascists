Drop whatever you are doing,
Stop your work and worry, too;
Sit right down and take it easy,
Here comes Woody and Lefty Lou.

You just drop a card or letter,
We will sing a song for you,
We're easy goin' country people
Plain ole Woody and Lefty Lou

(That's what we sing when we're cranking up and a-fixin' to come onto the air waves,
then after we have throughly wrecked the studio, here's what we sing):

So long! We'll see you in the morning,
We'll be singing when we do,
If you've got a favorite number,
Write to Woody and Lefty Lou

If you like our kind of singing,
I'm gonna tell you what to do,
Get your pencil and your paper
Write to Woody and Lefty Lou

If you're ever sad and lonely,
Bring your folk and chilluns too,
Hitch your bay mare to your buggy
Come see Woody and Lefty Lou

Don't forget us in the morning,
We won't be forgettin' you,
We ain't never seen a stranger,
Plain ole Woody and Lefty Lou.
