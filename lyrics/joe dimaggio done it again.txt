Joe Deemaggyo done it again!
Joe Deemaggyo done it again!
Clackin’ that bat, Gone with the wind!
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again.

Some folks thot Big Joe was done!
Some jus figgered Joe was gone!
Steps to the platter with a great big grin,
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again!

I’ma gonna tele ya jist th’ way I feel;
Man cain’t run without his heel;
Watch that raggypill split the wind!
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again!

All three fielders jumped their best;
Tryin’ ta climb that highboard fence;
They all growed whiskers on their chins!
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again!

Up along them clouds where the eagle roams;
Joe cracked that ball to whine and moaann;
His buddies laugh as they trot on in,
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again!

Grandmaw’s home by the radio
On the telleyevizzion awatchin’ Joe,
She jerks the beard offa grandpaw’s chin;
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again!

The puppydog barked at the pooseye kat;
How does it look from where you set?
Looks like a cyclone slidin’ in,
Joe Deemaggyo’s done it again!
