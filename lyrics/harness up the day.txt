It’s a wrinkled, crumbled, rumpled look
That’s scattered ‘cross my bed
Where a friend of mine now long gone
Used to lay her restless head
The moon would fall across the sky
The stars would take a peep
And I would stay awake at nights
To watch my lover sleep

Lots of history-making visions
Through my dusty brain would chase
When I’d see the moonlight shimmer
In the shadows on her face
The sun would chase the dreamy moon
The stars from out the skies
The day would break and I would see
The ocean in her eyes

And in the dew drop glitter
Of some radiant crystal spray
We’d saddle up the weather
And we’d harness up the day
Weld up the eaves and corners
Nail up the hoists and beams
Organize the day of work
To rivet to our dreams

It’s a wrinkled, crumbled, rumpled look
That’s scattered ‘cross my bed
Where a friend of mine now long gone
Used to lay her restless head
The moon would fall across the sky
The stars would take a peep
And I would stay awake at nights
To watch my lover sleep
