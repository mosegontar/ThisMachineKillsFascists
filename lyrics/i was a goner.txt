I was a goner in the last degree
Till I decided
That I had to break way
Had to untie my choke rope
And sneak back to you free
‘Cause I was a goner
In the last degree.

I was a goner
Of the gonest kind
Gone in my body
Gone in my mind
Till I saw one way how I
Could help your rebellion.
Sire, I’ve been a goner
Of the gonest kind.

I was a goner of the gonest kind.
I was a goner of the gonest kind.

I was a goner of the gonest kind
Checked in to go ten million times;
Surrendered, give up, cashed in
Or tried –
But I traveled right back
From your gone, goneland tonight.

To tell you, lost goner, to rest y’r mind
To let you know that you never find
No way to cheat your
Job at hand
Or battle to fight ta make peace on land.
