You get a hammer and I'll get a nail;
You catch a bird and I'll catch a snail;
You bring a board and I'll bring a saw,
and we'll build a house for the ba-by-o

CHORUS:
Bling blang, ham-mer with my ham-mer,
Zingo zango cutting with my saw.

I'll grab some mud and you grab some clay
So when it rains it won't wash away.
We'll build a house that'll be so strong,
The winds will sing my baby a song.

CHORUS

Run bring rocks and I'll bring bricks.
A nice pretty house we'll build and fix.
We'll jump inside when the cold wind blows
And kiss our pretty little baby-o.

CHORUS

You bring a ladder and I'll get a box.
Build our house out of bricks and blocks.
When the snowbird flies and the honeybee comes,
We'll feed our baby on honey in the comb.

CHORUS
