I hear that  prayer and praying
Will change this  world around
I fold my hands  I bow my head
I kneel down on  the ground

I prayed and prayed  by nite & day
And then I  prayed some more
I prayed till my  tongue was dry as dust
I prayed till my  knees had sores.

Will prayer  change shacks to decent homes?
Will prayer  change sickness into health?
Will prayer  change hate to works of love?
Will prayer get  me my right to vote?

Will prayer give  jobs at honest pay?
Will prayer  bring stomach full of food?
Will prayer make  rich treat poor folks right?
Will prayer take  out the Ku Klux Klan?

Will prayer cut  down the hoodlum bands?
Will prayer stop  the lynchbug hands?
If all of these  things my prayers can do,
I’ll pray till I  am black and blue.

If prayer will  bring us union love,
I’ll pray and  pray and pray some more.
I’ll pray all  day from door to door
And fall at nite  to pray some more
My prayer with a  union label.
