Who can guess the secret of the sea?
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
If you can guess the secret of my love for you
We both could know the secret of the sea

Tell me, could you ever tell the secret of the sea?
Of these high rolling waves along the shore?
The footprints of the lovers that come here to love,
By the tides washed away forever more

Who can guess the secret of the sea?
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
If you can guess the secret of my love for you
We both could know the secret of the sea

You claim to know the secret of a kiss and a hug
And the secret of the grass and of the trees
And if you can tell the secret of a warm friends hand
Then we all would feel the secrets of the sea
