Black diamond was a race horse, he held a high head
And the mane on his fore top is as fine as silk thread
I rode him in Texas, I rode him in Maine,
And I never did lose boys, I always did gain.

Come all of you good gamblers from far and near
She's likely to stumble, she's likely to fall,
And you"ll find old Black Diamond ahead of them all.

Come all of you gamblers from far and wide
And lay down your money when the Black Diamond rides,
Sit tight in your saddle, let slack on your rein,
You never will lose boys, you always will gain.

When the horses went racing, about half way 'round
The gray mare she stumbled, and fell to the ground.
And away out yonder ahead of the rest
Was my noble Black Diamond, the finest and best.

California's races has good ponies, too,
But I rode my Black Diamond and around them we flew.
Kentucky breeds horses that hold a good pace
But I rode my Black Diamond and won every race.

Florida's green pastures has champions to boast
But they follow behind when we come to the post
I stroked his black mane and I chuckled and laughed
The others were trailing by a neck and a half.

I win my good money and fill up my sack
'Cause it's always Black Diamond that's first down the track,
So bet him to win Boys, you never will fail,
'Cause it's always Black Diamond comes first down the rail.

This life is a gamble, it's a win, lose or draw
So I make love and gamble wherever I go
I'm friendly to strangers, and I love a good girl,
And I love my Black Diamond, the best in the world.
