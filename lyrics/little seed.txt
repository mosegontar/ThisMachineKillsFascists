CHORUS:
Tooky, tooky, tooky, tooky, tidalo,
Tooky, tooky, tooky, tooky, tidalo,
Let’s all dance around and see my little seed grow.

The rain it come and it washed my ground
I thought my little seed was going to drown
I waded and I splashed and I carried my seed
I planted it again on some higher ground.

Chorus

The sun got hot and my ground got dry.
I thought my little seed would burn and die.
I carried some water from a watering mill,
I said, “Little, you can drink your fill.”

Chorus

The snow it blowed and the wind it blew;
My little seed grew and it grew and it grew.
It grew up a cradle all soft inside;
And a baby was sleeping there covered over with vines.
