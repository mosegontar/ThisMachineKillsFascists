Take my brush, take my broom,
Clean and I clean around my room.
Clean and I clean around my room,
To make it pretty and shiny-o.

Take my polish, take my cloth,
Rub and I rub and I polish it off
Rub and I rub and I polish it off
To make it pretty and shiny-o.

Take my soap, take my clothes
Down and down in the water they go
Down and down in the water they go
To make them pretty and shiny-o.

Take my brush, scrub my teeth
Scrubble and scrabble, I brush my teeth
Bubble and blow, bubble and blow
To keep them pretty and shiny-o.

Tippy tappy toe, I go to bed
Close my eyes, I rest my head
Sleepy sleepy tight, sleepy sleepy tight
To make eyes pretty and shiny-o.
