Little darling, we have parted
From each other we must go
Many a mile may separate us
In this world of sin and woe

But that savior gave the promise
That you'd meet me in the land
Where you said we'd be together
When the roses bloom again

Down among the budded roses
Though my heart is sad with pain
I have parted from my darling
Never more to meet again

Will this parting be forever?
Will there be no dawning day?
When our hearts will be united
All our worries pass away

Now this parting is of sorrow
Yes, it almost breaks my heart
Tell me, darling, that you love me
When we're many miles apart

I will see you up in Heaven
This is my true and earnest prayer
If you love me here on earth, dear
I am sure you'll love me there

Down among the budded roses
Though my heart is sad with pain
I have parted from my darling
Never more to meet again
