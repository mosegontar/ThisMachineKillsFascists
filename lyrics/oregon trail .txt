I been a grubbin' on a little farm on the flat and windy plains
I been a list'nin to the hungry cattle bawl.
I'm gonna pack my wife and kids,
I'm gonna hit that western road.
I'm gonna hit that Oregon Trail this comin' fall.

Chrous

Now, my true love she gets ailin'
When this dry old dust gets sailin'
And she wishes for the days beyond recall
If we work hard there's a future
In that north Pacific land
I'm gonna hit that Oregon trail this comin' fall.

Chorus

Well my land is dry and cracklin'
and my chickens they're a cacklin'
'Cause this dirt and dust is getting' in their craw
They been layin' flint rock eggs
I got to bust 'em with a sledge
I got to hit that Oregon trail this comin' fall.

Chorus

Yes, my hogs and pigs are squealin'
They're a rockin' and a reelin'
'Cause there ain't no mud to waller in the draw
I'm gonna grab them by their tails
Take them down that western trail
I'm gonna hit that Oregon trail this comin' fall.

Chorus

Well, my good old horse in bony
And he's tired and lonsesome too
You can count his ribs three quarters of a mile
Throw my bedroll on his back
Both the bay horse and the black
I'm gonna hit that Oregon trail this comin' fall.

Chorus
I'm gonna hit that Oregon Trail this comin' fall,
I'm gonna hit that Oregon Trail this coming fall,
Where that good rain falls a plenty
Where the crops and orchards grow
I'm gonna hit that Oregon Trail this coming fall.
