How many hundred
Does it take
To grab me down
That Cadillac eight?

Cadillac eight
You get straight
Cadillac eight
You get straight
Grab me down
My Cadillac eight

If your Buick
Fools with me
I will run you
In the sea

If your Oldsmobile
Gets smart
I will beat you
From the start

If you Pontiac
Gives me pain
I will suck
You down the drain

If your Chevy
Touches me
I will run you
Up a tree

If your Dodge
With me gets wise
I will pass you
In the skies

If your Ford
Gives me a run
Iâ€™ll pass you
Like the rising sun

If your Hudson
Messes around
I will beat you
Right on down
