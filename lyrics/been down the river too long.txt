I doubt if I can write my right name down;
I been down this river too long;
I doubt if I can find your right house now;
I been down this river too long.

CHORUS:
I've been down this river mud too long;
Been down this river bank too long;
Chained on this prison farm too long;
Been down this river too long.

I doubt if I can 'member your right name now;
I been down this river too long;
I doubt if I write you a post card home;
I been down this river too long.

CHORUS

I don't know if you're livin' or dead;
I been down this river too long;
All I've got left is my achin' head;
I been down this river too long.

CHORUS

I just about come to the end of my days;
I been down this river too long;
Rider boss wasted my life away;
I been down this river too long.

CHORUS

I'm chained to a big iron ball for life;
I been down this river too long;
I cain't find you an' make y' my wife;
I been down this river too long.

CHORUS
