No more no more you'll hear from me
No more my letters you will read
No more the mailman walking by
Will give my words for you to see

No more I'll walk you down the street
No more play games along the sands
No more, no more, no more, no more;
You'll feel the touch of my warm hands.

No more letters, no more games
No more promises, no more rain
When my heartbreak wears away
No more letters

We had our spat and now I'm gone
You'll find some newer hand to hold;
No more, no more, no more, no more;
False promised words will burn my ear

Your sun will feel as good to you
My rain will feel the same to me
And when my heartbreak wears away
Then it will ache no more, no more.

Nor more letters, no more games
No more promises, no more rain
When my heartbreak wears away
No more letters

No more no more you'll hear from me
No more my letters you will read
No more letters
