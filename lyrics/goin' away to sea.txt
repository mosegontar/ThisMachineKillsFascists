‘Cause I’m goin' cross the water,
You can pack my things in order, babe of mine.

Don’t you go and leave a light, babe of mine,
Don’t you go and leave a light, babe of mine,
Don’t you go and leave a light
In your window, babe, tonight,
For the enemy to sight, babe of mine.

Don’t go talkin’ out of turn, babe of mine,
Don’t go talkin’ out of turn, babe of mine,
Don’t go talkin’ out of turn,
Don’t let Mister Hitler learn,
‘Cause I never would return, babe of mine.

‘Cause I’m full of rollin’ motion,
So I’m fightin’ on that ocean, babe of mine.

If this good old ship goes down, babe of mine,
If this good old ship goes down, babe of mine,
If this good old ship goes down,
Gonna swim right back to town,
I don’t intend to drown yet, babe of mine.

Oh, we got to win this race, babe of mine,
Oh, we got to win this race, babe of mine,
We’ve got to win this race,
Put them fascists in their place,
In their long and narrow grave, babe of mine.

I’m gonna come right back to you, babe o mine,
I’m gonna come right back to you, babe of mine,
I’m gonna come right back to you
When this war is won and through,
And we’ll ease back down to Georgia, babe of mine.

I’m gonna come right back to you
When this war is won and through,
When this war is won and through, babe of mine
