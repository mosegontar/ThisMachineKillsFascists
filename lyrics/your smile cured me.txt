You  might not have known it
Because  maybe Iâ€™ve not shown it
But  if you wanta really know what got me up
And  on the go
What  patched me up
From  my head to my toe
What  got me ready for my battle rattle
Way  over here, my rain and snow
You  wanta know, sweet dear, sweet dear
Your  smile cured me
Your  smile you threw across my ward here
Saved  my neck
And  cured my hide
Your  big laugh got me fixed out
And  your smile cure me.
Your  smile cure me.
