Why you afraid of life
Pack my heart and soul and mind
Would love to dwell?
Why am I afraid to say what I feel and need?
Why am I afraid to live a life I’d love?

Change the pen and change the ink
Change the way you talk and think
Change the tubes and change the tires
Change the things your heart desires
Change your makeup change your curl
Change the ways of this changing world
Change the ways of this changing world

Afraid to live, live, live!
Afraid to love, love, love!
Afraid to walk, walk, walk!
Afraid to talk, talk, talk!
I’m ‘fraid to live, yes, friend
I’m afraid to die

Change the pen and change the ink
Change the way you talk and think
Change the tubes and change the tires
Change the things your heart desires
Change your makeup change your curl
Change the ways of this changing world
Change the ways of this changing world
