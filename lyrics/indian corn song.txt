I been a restin’.
Ain't been a workin’
I been seetin' down.
I been a thinkin’
How the rich man runs the land.
How he promised
He would help us,
If we put him
Into office
How he turned his promises around.

Big dictators.
Speculators
Senators
And Agitators,
They tell what all they gonna do,
When they get
Into their office,
See what they can
Take off of us,
Take from me and take from you.

Finance-man
He frisk us, frisk us
Lawyer man,
He won't protect us,
Where O where is a honest man
Barber-man, he
Clip your whiskers
Money-man, he
Clip your sister.
Banker man, he take your land.

‘Cross the Country
I been lookin',
Seldom see
Anybody workin'
Is the work of the world all done
Come a big rain,
Come big thunder,
Come big crop
Plow crop under,
Indians never waste a one.

Can’t beat finance,
Man and weather,
Workin’ man got to
Got together,
Have a big meetin' down in town
Workin’-man gotta
Take the groceries
Feed the widows,
Feed the orphins.
Pass the groceries all around
