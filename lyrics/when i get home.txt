Well,  I been around this world a million times
And  I fought in all the fox holes and the lines
I  have rode every ship that rides the foam
And  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.

CHORUS:
Yes,  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.
And  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.

I  lifted and I carried and I hauled
I  answered all the bugles and the calls
And  at every sinking of the sun
I  thought of what I’ll do when I get home.

Yes,  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.
And  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.
I’m  gonna keep my fires burning
I’m  gonna keep my wheels a turning
I’m  gonna keep my people free when I get home.

I  lifted your shells and dropped your bombs.
Saw  this town and other towns blowed down.
I  talked to every Joe in the kingdom come
Told  him everything I’ll do when I get home.

Yes,  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.
And  I know just what I’ll do when I get home.
I’m  gonna keep my fires burning
I’m  gonna keep my wheels a turning
I’m  gonna keep my people free when I get home.
