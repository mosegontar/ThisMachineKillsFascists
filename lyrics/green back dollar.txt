I don't want your millions, mister.
I don't want your diamond ring.
All I want is the right to live mister.
Give me back my job again.

I don't want your Rolls Royce, mister,
I don't want your pleasure yacht,
All I want is food for my babies,
Now give to me my old job back.

I don't want your millions, mister.
I don't want your diamond ring.
All I want is the right to live mister.
Give me back my job again.

We worked to build this country, mister,
While you enjoyed a life of ease.
You've stolen all that we've built, mister,
Now our children starve and freeze.

I don't want your millions, mister.
I don't want your diamond ring.
All I want is the right to live mister.
Give me back my job again.

Yes, you have a land deed, mister,
The money is all in your name.
But where's the work that you did, mister?
I'm demanding back my job again.

I don't want your millions, mister.
I don't want your diamond ring.
All I want is the right to live mister.
Give me back my job again.

Think me dumb if you wish, mister,
Call me green or blue or red.
There's just one thing that I know, mister,
Our hungry babies must be fed.

I don't want your millions, mister.
I don't want your diamond ring.
All I want is the right to live mister.
Give me back my job again.

We'll organize together, mister,
In one big united band,
And with a Farmer-Labor party
We will win our just demands.

I don't want your millions, mister.
I don't want your diamond ring.
All I want is the right to live mister.
Give me back my job again.

Take the two old parties, mister,
No difference in them I can see.
But with a Farmer-Labor party,
We will set the workers free.
