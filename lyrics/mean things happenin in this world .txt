Look at th’ Big War ‘crost the Sea;
Well I’m sure that you’ll agree
There’s mean things a happenin’ in this world;

I ain’t got a cryin’ dime,
An’ I’m that a way all th’ time;
There’s mean things a happenin’ in this world;

Ever thing is leased and lent
And to Britain it has went;
And th’ Soldier in th’ War
Don’t know what he’s a fightin’ for;
And the Tanks a rollin’ on
To th’ burstin’ of th’ bombs;
Brother an’ Sister getting’ killed
For a green back dollar bill;
There’s Mean things a happenin’ in this World

Man and Woman lend an ear
To the War that’s drawin’ neat;
You are spied on by Police
If you Speak the Word of Peace;
If you talk ‘bout Broth’ly Love
Back in Jail you’ll get shoved;
O’ I’d ruther’d fight for Peace
Than this crooked Lend & Lease
There’s Mean things a happenin’ in this World

Folks wants Peace for miles aroun’
Lord, from New York City down;
But we’re a gonna save our Nation
With a Peace Mobilization;
Lord, the cops turn on th’ heat
If you talk Peace on th’ street
Organize my Brother and Sister
And we’ll win this World again;
There’s Mean things a happenin’ in this World
