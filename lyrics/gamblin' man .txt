Ah gambled down in Washington
Ah gambled down in Maine
Goin' down to Georgia
To knock down my last game
Ahm a gamiblin' Man man man,
Ahm a gambling' Man,
Ahm a gamblin'

I had not been in Washington
Many more weeks than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little gal
And she fell in love with me
ahm a Gamblin' Man man man,
Ahm a Gamblin' Man,
Ahm a gambling'

She took me in her parlour
Cooled me with her fan,
She said" Oh Mother, Mother
I'm in love with a gamblin' man"
Ahm a gambling' man, man etc.

She said "Oh Daughter, Daughter
How could you treat me so,
Leave your poor old Mother
And with that gambler go."
Ahm a gamblin' man, man etc.

I hear that train a-comin'
A-comin' round the curve
A-whistlin' and a-screamin'
Strainin' every nerve.
Ahm a gamblin' man, man etc.

I wouldn't marry a railroad man
And here's the reason why
I never knew a railroad man
Who wouldn't tell his wife a lie.
Ahm a gamblin' man, man etc.

I would marry a farmer
He's always in the rain
I'd rather marry a gamblin' man
With a big gold watch and chain.
Ahm a gamblin' man, man etc.

Man man man
Ahm a gamblin' man man man
Ahm a gamblin' man man man
Ahm a gambling" man.
