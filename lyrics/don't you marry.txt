Baby, don’t you  marry no farming man
Put a rake and a  shovel right in your hand
Don’t you marry  no railroad man
When you want  him he won’t be on hand.

So don’t go  marrying no business man
Got too much  monkey business on his hands
Don’t go marry  no jellybean man
Got too many  women on his hands.

CHORUS:
Just take me  back
Baby won’t you  take me back
I won’t do one  little thing
That you don’t  like.

O’ don’t you  marry no banker man
He’ll take all your  money from your hand
No, don’t you  marry no finance man
He’ll slap a big  mortgage right in your hand.

CHORUS

Don’t you marry  no travelin’ man
Always bummin’  off round in foreign lands
Don’t you marry  no singer man
He’s the brokest  feller in the band.

CHORUS

Don’t marry no  soldier nor sailer man
Always sailing  off and drinking in a distant land
Don’t marry  yourself no mariner man
Put the invasion  barge right in your hands

CHORUS
