Mailman walkin  by my cell
Mailman walkin  by my cell
It’s when you  don’t bring me no news
That’s the time  when I sing my jailcell blues
That’s the time  when I sing, that’s the time when I sing my jailcell blues.

When you walk  y’r mailpouch
When you walk  y’r mailpouch
By me with not  one word fr’m you
That’s the time  that I’ll weep my jailcell blues
That’s the time  that I’ll weep my jailcell blues.

Little leather  bag goes by me
Little leather  bag goes by me
Not one little  peep from you
Only time I cry  my jailcell blues
Only time I cry  my jailcell blues.
