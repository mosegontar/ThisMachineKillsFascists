There's my new star in heaven tonite tonite
There's my new star in heaven tonite
I call it fatherly father 'cause it shines so brite
There's my new star in heaven tonite

There's my new star in heaven tonite tonite
My new star in heaven tonite
It's when I'm gone I'll shine brite for you
My new star in heaven tonite

I see my new star in heaven tonite tonite
I see my new star in heaven tonite
I call it sisterly brother 'cause it shines so brite
It's my new star in heaven tonite

There's my new star in heaven tonite tonite
My new star in heaven tonite
It's when I'm gone I'll shine brite for you
My new star in heaven tonite
