I put my dolly's dress on,
I put my dolly's pants on,
I put my dolly's hat on
And she looks like this.

I put my dolly's stockings on,
I put my dolly's shoes on,
She acts just like a clown-o
And she looks like this.

CHORUS
O, well, she looks like this-o,
Oh well she looks like this-o.
Tra-la-la-la-la-lo
And she looks like this.

My dolly talks for me, me,
My dolly walks for me, me,
When dolly walks and talks
Oh, well, she looks like this.

My dolly she can sing, sing,
My dolly she can dance, dance,
When dolly sings and dances
Well, she looks like this.

CHORUS

Dolly says I want to eat, eat,
Dolly says I want to drink, drink,
When dolly eats and drinks
Well, she looks like this.

Dolly plays with all her toy, toys
Dolly plays with the girls and boy, boys
When dolly runs and skips
Oh, well, she looks like this.

CHORUS

I know my dolly likes me,
I know my dolly loves me,
When dolly hugs and kisses me
Well, we look like this.

Dolly says I'm getting tired now,
Dolly says I want to lay down,
When dolly goes to sleep
Oh, well, she looks like this.

CHORUS
