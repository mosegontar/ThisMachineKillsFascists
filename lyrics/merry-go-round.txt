Oh, come and see the merry-go-round,
The merry-go-round, the merry-go-round!
Come and see the merry-go-round
Go round and round and round!

Come let's rub the pony's hair,
Come let's rub the pony's hair,
Lots of ponies that we can ride
Round and round and round.

Now let's climb on the pony's back,
Now let's climb on the pony's back,
Pick up my reins and buckle my straps,
And round and round and round.

It's faster now my pony runs
Up to the moon and down to the sun;
My pony runs to the music and drums,
Round and round and round.

Now he runs as fast as the winds
And gallops and trots and dances a jig;
Pony's tired and he wants to slow down
Round and round and round.

The pony stops and off I climb,
Off I climb, off I climb;
I'll come back and ride some other time
Round and round and round.
