Who's gonna talk your future over 
While I'm rambling in the West

CHORUS:
At my window sad and lonely 
Often do I think of thee 
And I wonder, little darling 
If you ever think of me

You will meet with many faces 
Some will tell you I'm not true 
Please remember, little darling 
No one loves you like I do

CHORUS

Who's gonna hold you to that, little darling 
Who's gonna hold you to their breast 
Who's gonna talk your future over 
While I'm rambling in the West

CHORUS
