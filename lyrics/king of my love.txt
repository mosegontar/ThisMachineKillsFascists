I'll be the Queen of your heart, Dear
You'll be the King of my love
I'll deal through that whole deck to find you
And You'll wait for my time to come.

I've lived a lone life dear without you
I played a lone hand all the way;
I ached when I lost, I pretended to laugh;
But I felt more like crying these days.
Since you come and stood there beside me
And told me my best way to play
Your hand touched mine and the sunshine did shine
And we left that whole card house next day.

I'll be the Queen of your heart, Dear
You'll be the King of my love
I'll deal through that whole deck to find you
And You'll wait for my time to come.

Rough Jack didn't like you to help me
He would kill you if you left with me.
Jack's two forty fours drilled round that door
As we backed hand in hand to the street.
Jack turned his last slug on his own self
Pitched down on the sawdusty floor
That's why you're the King of my love now
That's why I trust cards nevermore.

I'll be the Queen of your heart, Dear
You'll be the King of my love
I'll deal through that whole deck to find you
And You'll wait for my time to come.

I tossed off my cardhouse costumery
I slipped on my sweet cotton dress
You're king of our house here my darling
No turn of a cardhand can wreck.
You're king of my big sunny smile now
You're king of my red rosy cheeks
I'm queen of this cradle that rocks here
No joker can steal me away.

I'll be the Queen of your heart, Dear
You'll be the King of my love
I'll deal through that whole deck to find you
And You'll wait for my time to come.
