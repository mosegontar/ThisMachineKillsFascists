Well, I just got up to my new found land,
My new found land, my new found land.
I just got up to my new found land,
I'm a livin' by the light of the morning.

I built me a house of a new cut tree,
A new cut tree, a new cut tree.
I built me a house of a new cut tree,
I'm a livin' in the light of the morning.

Well, I built my house on a new cut stone,
A new cut stone, a new cut stone.
I built my house on a new cut stone,
I'm a livin' in the light of the morning,
Livin' in the light of the morning.

I lit my lamp with a new-found light,
A new-found light, a new-found light,
I lit my lamp with a new-found light
And I'm a-livin' in the light of the morning.

I'm plantin' my feet in the new-dug ground,
The new-dug ground, the new-dug ground.
I'm plantin' my feet in the new-dug ground
I'm livin' in the light of the morning,
Livin' in the light of the morning.

I brought my child for my new found-wife,
My new-found wife, my new-found wife.
I brought my child for my new-found wife
Livin' in the light of the morning,
Livin' in the light of the morning.

Well, I just got up to my new-found land,
My new-found land, my new-found land.
I just got up to my new-found land,
I'm livin' in the light of the morning,
Livin' in the light of the morning.
