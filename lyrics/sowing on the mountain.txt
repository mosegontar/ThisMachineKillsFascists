Sowing on the mountain, Reaping in the valley;
Sowing on the mountain, Reaping in the valley;
Sowing on the moun tain, Reaping in the valley,
You're gonna reap just what you sow.

God gave Noah the rainbow sign
God gave Noah the rainbow sign
God gave Noah the rainbow sign
It won't be water, but fire next time.

Won't be water, but fire next time
Won't be water, but fire next time
Won't be water, but fire next time
God gave Noah the rainbow sign.
