Night drink likkor, night drink rum,
I drink Lemonade and Buttermilk some,
Here’s my drink which I always choose,
I’m a Jake Walk Daddy with the Jake Walk Blues.

I got me a Mama down in New Orleans
She’s long and tall, she’s  keen I mean;
I lost my woman, I’m a singing the Blues,
I’m a Jake Walk Daddy with the Jake Walk Blues.

I caint eat and I caint talk,
Been drinking Jake and now I caint walk,
Lost my clothes and working shoes
I’m a Jake Walk Daddy with the Jake Walk Blues.

Down in Texas  there is a moonshine
To make a ginger, make you paralyzed
I won’t let that troubled mind
I’m a Jake Walk Daddy with the Jake Walk Blues.

You don’t want me, gimme your left hand
Gonna take a jug to my buried land
Legs are stiff like a new pair of shoes
I’m a Jake Walk Daddy with the Jake Walk Blues.
