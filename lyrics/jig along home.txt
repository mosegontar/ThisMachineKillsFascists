Well, I went to the dance and the animals come,
Jaybird danced with horse-shoes on.
Grasshopper danced till he fell on the floor
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

Chorus:
Jig jiga jig jiga jig along home,
Jig jiga jig jiga jig along home.
Jig along, jig along, jig along home,
Jig jiga jig jiga jig along home.

Centipede danced with the big giraffe,
Spider danced with the rattlesnake,
Elephant danced with the scorpio,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

Fishing worm done the fishing reel,
Lobster danced on the peacock’s tail,
Baboon danced with the rising moon,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

And the rooster cut his weevily wheat,
The catfish tromped the cuckoo’s feet,
The ostrich stomped with the kangaroo,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

Mama rat took off her hat,
Shook the house with the old tom cat,
The alligator beat his tail on the drum,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

The boards did rattle and the house did shake,
The clouds did laugh and the world did quake,
New moon rattled some silver spoons,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.

The nails flew loose and the floors broke down,
Everybody danced around and around,
The house come down and the crowd went home,
Jig along, jig along, jig along home.
