Come to my House of Earth if you would like
For me to give your old time feelings back.

Come here to my house of good rich earth if you
Would like me teach your wife a thing or two.

Come here to this legal illegal place for joys
And teach your wife this way to grow new boys.

I’ll take you by your had and show you whirls
Of these same feelings that grow pretty girls.

I’ll wash your feet a couple of times a day
Till all your old time sorrows melt away.

You leave some drops of honey on my couch
I leave a couple of dollars in your pouch.

My house of earth is the richest land in town
I pity those dead ones that at me frown.

SO come to my house of earth and learn it’s worth
A few green folded bills to learn of birth.

I’ll kiss you in such odd and natural ways
Your wife will then find out that kissing pays.

Two times a day I’ll wash you in my tub
Ten times a day I’ll pat your skin and rub.

Call me a prostitute and a whore, too,
I do these tricks your wife refuses to.

I swear by all my bibles you won’t regret
I’ve never met a man that’s sorry yet.

I love you once to teach you all your life
The things to do when you are with your wife.

Your wife should be quite glad and proud of me
For waking both of you up these things to see.

My house of earth runs down with wine and rum
Lots of different ways here you can come.

If you do come I will be glad to see
If you don’t come I’m glad you don’t need me.

I’ll furnish red hot kisses and the hole
That wakes up sleeping sickness in your soul.
