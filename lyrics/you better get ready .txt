I had a dream the other night.
Sing on, brother, sing;
About this war we've got to fight
Sing on, brother, sing;
I dreamt the Devil come to me,
And he woke me up from out of my sleep;
And here is what he said to me,
Sing on, brother, sing.

Chorus: You better get ready, brother!
You better get ready, sister!
You better get ready,
'Cause you know you've got to fight!
You better get ready, brother!
You better get ready, sister!
You better get ready,
'Cause you may be called tonight!

I raised up from out o' my bed;
Sing on brother, sing!
And to the devil, this I said:
Sing on, brother, sing!
Pray, tell me, sir, what brings you here?
Trifling? Gambling? Wine or beer?
Or is my doomsday drawing near?
Sing on, neighbor, sing.

CHORUS

The Devil opened his big black book;
Sing on, sister, sing!
He opened it up and took a look;
Sing on, brother, sing!
He read off Adolph Hitler's name;
He said "Old Hell just ain't the same!
Compared to the Nazis, Hell's too tame!"
Sing on, sisters, sing!

CHORUS

I then pulled on my fighting pants;
Sing on, brother, sing!
The Devil of Hell he sung and danced!
Sing on, sister, sing!
He said: "If you'll go and win this war,
And chase that super chase out for sure,
I'll never raise Hell on earth no more!"
Sing on, parder, sing!

CHORUS
