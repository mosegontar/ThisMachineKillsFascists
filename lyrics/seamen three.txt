We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Shipped out to beat the fascists
Across the land and sea.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
We outsung all o' you Nazis
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
We talked up for the NMU
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Outsung all o' you finks and ginks
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Worked to haul that TNT
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
If you ever saw one you'd see all three
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Torpedoed twice and robbed with dice
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Not many pretty lasses did we miss
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Ocean's still a-ringin' with songs we sung
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
We fight and sing for the Willy McGhees
Across our lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Keep a-fightin' and a-singin' till the world gets free
Across my lands and seas.

We were seamen three,
Cisco, Jimmy and me;
Gonna keep workin' and a-fightin' for peace
Across my lands and seas.
