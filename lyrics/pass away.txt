Heaven and earth they'll pass away pass away
Heaven and earth gonna pass away pass away
Heaven heaven heaven
and earth bound to pass away
But my words
They'll never ever pass away

City and town they'll pass away pass away
Town and city both pass away pass away
Dreams and stars they’ll pass away
Not a word of mine
Will ever pass away

Country and farm they’ll pass away pass away
Farm and country they’ll pass away pass away
Not a word of mine
Will ever pass away

Heaven and earth they'll pass away pass away
Heaven and earth gonna pass away pass away
Heaven heaven heaven
and earth bound to pass away
Not a word of mine
Will ever pass away
