I was there when my good ship went down
I was there when my good ship went down
I shook you by your hand and thought of home again
I was there when my good ship went down

Oh the night was as bright as the day
Oh the night was as bright as the day
All my comrades feeling fine as we drank a jug of wine
I was there when my good ship went down

I seen the doctors walking in the night
I seen doctors there walking in the night
And the doctor drunk his whiskey as I drunk my wine
I was there when our good ship went down

I seen the gunboy was carried from his deck
I seen the gunboy was carried from his deck
The doctor took a drink and sewed ten stitches in his neck
I was there when our good ship went down

Seventy gunners was at the movie down below
Seventy gunners at the movie down below
They grabbed films in their hands and looked at it by matches
I was there when my good ship went down

I heard the old bos'n laugh out on the deck
I heard the old bos'n laugh out on the deck
I don't give a good Goshdern if I lose my bloody neck
I was there when my good ship went down

I heard our captain yell down from off his bridge
I heard our captain yell down from off his bridge
"We've got a thirty six foot hole in our number two hatch"
I was there when my good sip went down

Go stand by your lifeboats men and wait
Go stand by your lifeboats men and wait
If she rolls over another inche we will leave her to the sea
I was there when our good ship went down

I see six ships go up in the night
I seen six ships go up in the night
I seen bright explosions and I knew this was the fight
I was there when my good ship went down

In the morning when the sun come to the skies
In the morning when the sun come to the skies
We was drifting all alone and not another ship in sight
I was there when my good ship went down

This was just one thing them Nazis have done
This is just one little thing the Nazis gone and done
I hope that you will remember when the war is won and gone
I was there when my good ship went down
