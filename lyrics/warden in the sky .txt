I stand with prison bars around me
And we have kissed our last goodbye
I walk my last long mile at midnight
To meet my warden in the skies

I see the stars in all their glory
Out my window as they shine
They ask me is my spirit ready
To meet my warden in the skies

Without your love I would feel guilty
Your kisses, dear, my feet will guide
Your hopes and dreams will light my path, dear
To meet my warden in the skies

Your love I'll tell to all my buddies
When I cross to life's other side
I'll answer work-call in the morning
With my warden in the skies

These walls of rocks and stone around me
These bars of iron I leave behind
I'll write your letters on the moonbeams
From my warden in the skies

Without your love I would feel guilty
Your kisses, dear, my feet will guide
Your hopes and dreams will light my path, dear
To meet my warden in the skies
