Condorbird my wonderbird
Spread out your wings and sail for me
Condorbird my wonderbird
Spread out your big wings fly for me.

Condorbird my wanderin' bird
Wing it up and outta sight for me
Condorbird my wanderin' bird
Wing it up and outta sight for me.

Condorbird my brotherbird
Hatch me out some freedom on my place here
Condorbird my sisterbird
Fly'n hatch a little sprig of freedom for me.

Condorbird my motherbird
Hatch out some freedom lands for me
Condorbird my fatherbird
Fly hatch some big big freedom lands for me.

Condorbird my loverbird
Fly tell my lover come fight for me
Condorbird my loverbird
Fly tell my lover come here and fight for me.
