I’m  just a dopefiend robber you read and hear about
I’ve  kick a million joints I to grab my swag and go
I’ve  pushed a million drugstores with my pistol in my hand
I’m  just a dopefiend robber and dope robbing is my game.

I  doubled my haul in old St. Paul  and I spun to New Orleans
Met  a Cajun girl that loved stuff while I was in the green.
I  showed her how to hold my gat and go break my drugstore
After  I showed her a dozen or so she broke ‘em bettern I could

Seen  my town of Reno  we grabbed our biggest haul
Some  heads around the town said you’re in my territore
Just  fork me over your take friend and walk away in peace
My  girl put nine holes in him before he spoke his piece.

She  runoff down blind alley where his whoremob shot her down
I  counted thirty-two blasts they fired to keep her on that ground
I  run and jumped me a fast boxcar down Reno’s  hill
My  clothes pokedfull of good hot money from heroin till and kill

I  buy your bestole finest wine, I buy it by the barrel.
I  pour it down my prettiest whores, my street hustling girls
I  buy my greenystamp whisky, I buy it by the case
I  get myself drunk and have a little fuckin race

One seventeen year old bitch tells me,  now you’ve knocked me up
You’ll  havta fork me a thousand to pay my knocker doc.
Here  take this gun and come with me tonight,
I’ll  teach ya how to rob and you can payoff your doc.

I  kicked my bell and run like hell and left her here alone
My  trolyboys drilled her sixteen holes because she had my gun
She  laid with a hundred and sixty men and told me such lies
I  celebrated with four more whores the night I heard she died.

I’m  just your dopefiend robber you read and hear about
I’ve  kicked a million joints in to grab my swag and drag
My  coffeepot is whistling me, I’d better be hittin my trail
My  bluecoat boys are here to haul my ashes off ta jail.
