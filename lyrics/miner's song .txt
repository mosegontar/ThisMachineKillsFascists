CHORUS: Dig and I dig and dig and dig
Dig diggy dig dig dig a dig
Dig diggy diggy dig dig
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

Precious metal is hard to find
Precious metal is hard to find
Down in the hole and down in the mine
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

Perfect ruby is hard to find
Perfect ruby is hard to find
Down in the gold slush and shine
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

Good-shaped diamond's hard to find
Good-shaped diamond's hard to find
Go in the hole both day and night
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

CHORUS

Nice round pearl's hard to find
Nice round pearl's hard to find
Dive to the bottom and feel around
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

Old Sam Digger is hard to find
Old Sam Digger is hard to find
Drink my wine with pickle and brine
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

Nice-shaped woman is hard to find
Nice-shaped woman is hard to find
Roll 'em down the mountainside
And I dig my life away-o
And I dig my life away

CHORUS

Way down yonder on the buckskin road
Catfish married a horny toad
The fifteen kids dig down in the mines
They dig their lives away-o
They dig their lives away

Sharecrop bottom a few days ago
Water got high, spread a lot of mud
Caught me a gal with a rake and a hoe
We dug our lives away-o
And we dig our lives away

Climb way up to the forks of the tree
Prettiest little bird nest I ever did see
Get up the sticks and eggs and all
And dig my life away-o
Well I dug my life away

CHORUS
