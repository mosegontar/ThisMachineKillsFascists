Put your finger in the air, in the air;
Put your finger in the air, in the air;
Put your finger in the air
And leave it about a year;
Put your finger in the air, in the air.

Put your finger on your head, on your head;
Put your finger on your head, on your head;
Put your finger on your head
Tell me if it's green or red?
Put your finger on your head on your head.

Put your finger on your nose, on your nose;
Put your finger on your nose, on your nose;
Put your finger on your nose
And feel the cold wind blow;
Put your finger on your nose, on your nose.

Put your finger on your shoe, on your shoe;
Put your finger on your shoe, on your show;
Put your finger on your shoe
And leave it a day or two;
Put your finger on your shoe, on your shoe.

Put your finger on your chin, on your chin;
Put your finger on your chin, on your chin;
Put your finger on your chin -
That's where the food slips in;
Put your finger on your chin, on your chin.

Put your finger on your cheek, on your cheek;
Put your finger on your cheek on your cheek;
Put your finger on your cheek
And leave it about a week;
Put your finger on your cheek, on your cheek.

Put your finger on your finger, on your finger;
Put you finger on your finger, on your finger;
Put your finger on your finger,
On your finger on your finger;
Put your finger on your finger, on your finger.

Put your fingers all together, all together;
Put your fingers all together, all together;
Put your fingers all together
And we'll clap for better weather;
Put your fingers all together, all together.
