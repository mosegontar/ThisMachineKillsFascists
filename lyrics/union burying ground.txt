I see they're low'ring a right new coffin,
I see they're letting down a right new coffin,
Way over in that union burying ground.

And the new dirt's a falling on a right new coffin,
The new dirt's a falling on a right new coffin,
Way over in that union burying ground.

Oh, tell me, who's that they're letting down, down?
Tell me, who's that they're letting down, down?
Way over in that union burying ground.

Another union organizer,
Another union organizer,
Way over in that union burying ground.

A union brother and a union sister,
A union brother and a union sister,
Way over in that union burying ground.

A union father and a union mother,
A union father and a union mother,
Way over in that union burying ground.

Well, I'm a gonna sleep in a union coffin,
I'm a gonna sleep in a union coffin,
Way over in that union burying ground.

Every new grave brings a thousand new ones,
Every new grave brings a thousand members,
Way over in that union burying ground.

Every new grave brings a thousand brothers,
And every new grave brings a thousand sisters
To the union in that union burying ground.
