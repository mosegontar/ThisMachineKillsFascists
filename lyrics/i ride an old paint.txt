Ride around, little dogie, ride around them slow,
They're fiery and snuffy and raring to go.
Ride around, little dogie, ride around them slow,
Fiery and snuffy and raring to go.

Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son
Son went to college and the daughter went wrong
His wife got killed in a free-for-all fight
But still he keeps singing from morning to night

Ride around, little dogies, ride around them slow,
Fiery and snuffy and raring to go.

I'll ride the old paint, lead the old Dan
go to Montana to throw the hoolian,
I'll feed 'em in the coulees, water in the draw
Tails are all matted, their backs are all raw.

Ride around, little dogie, ride around them slow,
Fiery and snuffy and raring to go.

I worked in the town, I worked on the farm
All I got to show was just this muscle in my arm
Blisters on my feet, callus on my hand
Goin' to Montana to throw the hoolian

Ride around, little dogie, ride around them slow,
Fiery and snuffy and raring to go.
