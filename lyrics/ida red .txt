Down the river and across the creek
Don't get a letter but once a week.
Down the river and across the creek
Don't get a letter but once a week.

CHORUS: Ida Red, Ida Red,
Can't make a living for Ida Red
Ida Red, Ida Red,
Can't make a living for Ida Red

Ida Red, big and plump
Eighty-four inches around the rump
Ida Red, big and plump
Eighty-four inches around the rump

CHORUS

Ida Red jumped the fence
I ain't seen my Ida since
Ida Red jumped the fence
I ain't seen my Ida since

CHORUS

Hurry up boy and on you go
Circle four in the middle of the floor
Maybe the last time, I don't know
Hurry up lord, don't go slow

Buy me a horse, buy me a sled
Take me riding, Ida Red
Buy me a horse, buy me a sled
Take me riding, Ida Red

CHORUS
