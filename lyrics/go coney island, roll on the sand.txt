Walk like a lady
Ride like a man
Hop skip and jump
Keep warm my hand
Boat on the water
Train on the land
Go Coney Island
Roll on the sand.

Hot dog with mustard
On face and hands
Root beer and burgers
Pickles and ham
Blintzes and cheeses
Knishes and spam
Go Coney Island
Roll on the sand.

CHORUS:
Roll on the sand, sand,
Roll on the sand,
My sugar lump's dancin', hot in the pan
Go Coney Island, every woman and man
Go Coney Island, roll on the sand.

Weiners and sodas
Hot dog and pop
Feet got no shoes on
Sidewalks burns hot
Suntan and windburn
Traffic a jam
Go Coney Island
Roll on the sand.

CHORUS

Lots of dark glasses
Clothes not so much
I see pretty people
Push up and shove
I smell salt waters
Feel run and dance
Go Coney Island
Roll on the sand.

CHORUS
