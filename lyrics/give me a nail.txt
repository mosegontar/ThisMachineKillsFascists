Give me a nail  and I’ll nail it;
Give me a ship  and I’ll sail it;
Give  me a bugle and I’ll toot it;
Give  me a gun and I’ll shoot it;

Give me the work  and I’ll do it;
Give me the stew  and I’ll stew it;
Give  me the bell and I’ll ring it;
Give  me the song and I’ll sing it!

Give me the  words and I’ll talk ‘em;
Give me the  miles an’ I’ll walk ‘em;
Give  me the crop and I’ll grow it;
Give  a row and I’ll hoe it!

Give me a life  and I’ll live it;
Give me a life  and I’ll give it;
Give  me a war and I’m in it;
Give  me a world and I’ll win it!
