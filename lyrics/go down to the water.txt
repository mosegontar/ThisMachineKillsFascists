Go down to the  water where oil floats by
Drop your hair  down and cry
And write with  your finger in the sand
Mail it out with  the tide.
Mail  it out with the high and the low
Watch  the marks in the sand
Listen  to the fog on the homeless waves
And  feel the salt sea in your hands.

Smell that sea  wind, taste on your lips
That foam that  rolls over my lost ships
And write your  letter once more in the sand
Where the  breaker dips and our undertow slips.
Kneel  down and feel the waters edge
Write  our names side by side
And  look and listen to all those ships
That  toss in the fog and in the tides.

Let down your  hair when you kneel down there
Let me be the  wind that pulls your hair
And you be the  man you made out of sand
And let your  hands keep making him there.
When  nobody is looking kiss your hand
And  touch to the nose of your man in the sand
Then  lay down with your head on his chest
Be  nice, be nice to your man on the sand.
