Times are gittin hard, folks;
They might git harder still;
No matter who wins office
In that Big House on the hill;
If ya wanta git by at all
I know you already by now should know:

Some fellers cuss as good times come and go;
But, I got my wild card in the hole;
Some wise ones play every sucker trick they know;
But, I still got my wild card in the hole.

Some Janes line up on that old eazy come;
That's their wild card in the hole;
Some girlies tease for that old eazy mon;
That's her wild card in the hole.

Good folks line up for that sweet piece of change;
That's their wild card in the hole;
Some work their stunts on the quick subway train;
That's their wild card in the hole.

Slick fingers know where th' little ball will roll;
That's their wild card in the hole;
Some pay for tips where th' wind's gonna blow;
That's their wild card in the hole...

Some fellers cuss as good times come and go;
But, I got my wild card in the hole;
Some wise ones play every sucker trick they know;
But, I still got my wild card in the hole.

Shake the sucker dry
I'm a letting ya on th' inside fur nuttin'

Times are gittin hard, folks;
They might git harder still;
No matter who wins office
In that Big House on the hill;
If ya wanta git by at all
I know you already by now should know
