Love thyself most and best
Love thyself day and night
Let no feared word cause thee
To hate thyself

Love thyself last and first
Love thyself more each month
Let no scared howl cause thee
To doubt thyself

Love thyself more and more
Love thyself loud and long
Let no bad dream make thee
Mistrust thyself

Thyself is all you'll have
From cradle to thy grave
Love yours enough to make
Us love ourselves

Thyself is all you'll have
From cradle to thy grave
Love yours enough to make
Us love ourselves
