Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

Open eyes, open eyes, open eyes, open eyes
Open eyes, open eyes, open eyes, open eyes
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Open eyes, open eyes, open eyes, open eyes.

Stretch arms, stretch arms, stretch arms, stretch arms
Stretch arms, stretch arms, stretch arms, stretch arms
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Stretch arms, stretch arms, stretch arms, stretch arms.

Stretch feet, stretch feet, stretch feet, stretch feet
Stretch feet, stretch feet, stretch feet, stretch feet
Wake up, open eyes, and stretch your arms
Stretch feet, stretch feet, stretch feet, stretch feet.

Stretch hands and toes and hands and toes
And hands and toes and hands and toes
Wake up and stretch your arms and feet
Stretch hands and toes and hands and toes.

Wake up and play with all your toys
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
And play with all the girls and boys
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up and see the sun shine in
And listen to all the things outside
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.
