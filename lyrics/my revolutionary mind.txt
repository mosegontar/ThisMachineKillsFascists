Night is here again, baby,
Stretched out on my bed
Seeing all kinds of crazy notions
Running around through my head

One hand is on my pillow,
One hand on my head,
I see a million  nightmares
Tearing around in my  head;

I need a progressive woman;
I need an awfully liberal woman.
I need a social conscious  woman
To ease my revolutionary  mind.

If I could only make you  see, babe,
I ache and pain and  bleed, babe,
I know you’d come a  runnin;
If you blistered both  your feet.

If you could see me here, baby,
Broke out with salty sweat;
No matter where you go I know
You never could forget.

I need a progressive woman;
I need an awfully liberal woman.
I need a social conscious  woman
To ease my revolutionary  mind.

I need a progressive woman;
I need an awfully liberal woman.
Ain’t no reactionary baby
Can ease my revolutionary  mind.
