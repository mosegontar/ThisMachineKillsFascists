Let me walk back in my vision
Down this old remembered road
Let me walk back past my trees and street
To this old friendly door

Let me see my people's faces
In my little old hometown
Let me see them one more time
Just one more time

Let me go here one more time
And one more time
Let me go here one more time
And one more time

Let me see you, let me hear you
Let me meet you, let me greet you
Let me go there one more time
And one more time

Let me see your city limits
Let me walk along your walk
Let me glance into your faces
Let me listen to you talk

Let me stand around this corner
Where the boys meet all the girls
Let me stand here one more time
Just one more time

Let me go here one more time
And one more time
Let me go here one more time
And one more time

Let me see you, let me hear you
Let me meet you, let me greet you
Let me go there one more time
And one more time

Let me see you like I saw you
At your work there working hard
Let me see you sweeping, dusting
Tending flowers in your yard

Let me see that flirty girly
That has always held my heart
Let me feel this one more time
And one more time

Let me go here one more time
And one more time
Let me go here one more time
And one more time

Let me see you, let me hear you
Let me meet you, let me greet you
Let me go there one more time
And one more time

Let me hold your hand and walk you
Down our boardwalk to our square
Let us talk our future over
Like we did when I was there

Let me hear your words as I heard
On our dark and stormy night
Let me hear them one more time
And one more time

Let me go here one more time
And one more time
Let me go here one more time
And one more time

Let me see you, let me hear you
Let me meet you, let me greet you
Let me go there one more time
And one more time
