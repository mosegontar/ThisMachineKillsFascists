I’ve been beatin’ my way around
In and out of a thousand towns;
But, old L.A.  looks good to me.
L.A. sweetheart  sweeter than honey;
Works all day and gives me the money
That’s why L.A.  looks good to me.

CHORUS:
Old LA, it’s a pretty fair place to be
Old LA, it’s a pretty fair place to be
Looks good to me, looks good to me
When I kiss you and you kiss me,
Makes me glad we both agree
That’s why LA looks good to me

It’s hey, hey, hey and ho, ho, hooo;
Our kids just like this town will grow;
That’s why LA looks good to me

CHORUS
