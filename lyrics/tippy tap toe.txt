Tippy tap toe, my little sugar plum,
'Round you go,  my little sugar plum,
Tippy tap toe, my little angel,
And around and around you go.

Runny run run, my little sugar plum,
'Round you come, my little sugar plum,
Runny, run run, my little sweety pie,
And around and around you go.

On your toes, my little sugar plum,
Toesy toes, my little sugar plum,
'Round you go, my little sugar bun,
And around and around you go.

Clap your hands, my little sugar plum,
Clap, clap hands, my little sugar loaf,
Clap, clap hands, my little tickletoe,
And around and around you go.

Now fly like a bird, my little sugar plum,
Fly like a bird, my little sweety pie,
Flap your wings, my little angel,
And around and around you go.

Now hop like a rabbit, my little sugar plum,
Hop like a rabbit, my little honeycomb,
Zippety hop, my little sweet thing,
And around and around you go.

'Round you go, my little sweet thing,
'Round you go, my little honey bun,
'Round you go, my little sunnyshine,
And around and around you go.
