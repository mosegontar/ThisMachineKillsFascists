Make me a bed right down on your floor,
Make me a bed right down on your floor,
I'll lay my head in a bed on your floor.

I'm a poor lonesome boy, I'm a long ways from home,
I'll lay my head in a bed on your floor.

Clock striking midnight and daylight to go,
I'll lay my head in a bed on your floor.

Sheriff on my trail with a big forty-four,
I'll lay my head in a bed on the floor.

Bed on the floor, baby, bed on the floor,
I'll lay a bed right down on your floor,
I'll lay my head in a bed on your floor.

Poor lonesome boy, I'm a long ways from home,
I'm a poor lonesome boy, I'm a long ways form home,
I'll lay my head right down on your floor.
